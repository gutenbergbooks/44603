<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>The number of works dealing with old English
furniture has grown rapidly during the last ten
years. Not only has the subject been broadly
treated from the historic or from the collector's
point of view, but latterly everything has been
scientifically reduced into departments of knowledge,
and individual periods have received detailed
treatment at the hands of specialists.</p>

<p>Museums and well-known collections, noblemen's
seats and country houses have furnished photographs
of the finest examples, and these, now well-known,
pieces have appeared again and again as illustrations
to volumes by various hands.</p>

<p>It is obviously essential in the study of the history
and evolution of furniture-making in this country
that superlative specimens be selected as ideal types
for the student of design or for the collector, but
such pieces must always be beyond the means of the
average collector.</p>

<p>The present volume has been written for that large
class of collectors, who, while appreciating the beauty
and the subtlety of great masterpieces of English
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
furniture, have not long enough purses to pay the
prices such examples bring after fierce competition
in the auction-room.</p>

<p>The field of minor work affords peculiar pleasure
and demands especial study. The character of the
cottage and farmhouse furniture is as sturdy and independent
as that of the persons for whom it was made.
For three centuries unknown cabinet-makers in towns
and in villages produced work unaffected by any
foreign influences. Linen-chests, bacon-cupboards,
Bible-boxes, gate tables, and other tables, dressers,
and chairs possess particular styles of treatment in
different districts. The eighteenth-century cabinet-makers
scattered up and down the three kingdoms
and in America found in Chippendale's "Director"
a design-book which stimulated them to produce
furniture of compelling interest to the collector.</p>

<p>The examples of such work illustrated in this
volume have been taken from a wide area and are
such as may come under the hand of the diligent
collector in various parts of the country.</p>

<p>In view of the increased love of collecting homely
furniture suitable for modern use, it is my hope
that this book may find a ready welcome,
especially nowadays, when so many of the picturesque
architectural details of old homesteads
are being reproduced in the garden suburbs of
great cities.</p>

<p>It is possible that the authorities of local museums
may find in this class of furniture a field for special
research, as undoubtedly specimens of local work
should be secured for permanent exhibition before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
they are dispersed far and wide and their identity
with particular districts lost for ever.</p>

<p>In regard to the scientific study of farmhouse and
cottage furniture, the ideal arrangement is that
followed at Skansen, Stockholm, and at Lyngby,
near Copenhagen. In the former a series of buildings
have been erected in the open air, in connection
with the Northern Museum, gathered from every
part of Sweden, retaining their exterior character
and fitted with the furniture of their former
occupants. It was the desire of the founder, Dr.
Hazelius, to present an epitome of the national life.
Similarly at Lyngby, an adjunct of the <i>Dansk
Folkemuseum</i> at Copenhagen, the life-work of Hr.
Olsen has been given to gathering together and
re-erecting a large number of old cottages and
farmhouses from various districts in Denmark, from
Iceland, the Faroe Islands, and from Norway and
Sweden. These have their obsolete agricultural
implements, and old methods of fencing and quaint
styles of storage. The furniture stands in these
specimen homes exactly as if they were occupied.
It is a remarkable open-air museum, and the idea is
worthy of serious consideration in this country. Old
cottages and farmhouses are fast disappearing, and
the preservation of these beauties of village and
country life should appeal to all lovers of national
monuments.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
In connexion with farmhouse furniture, old chintzes
is a subject never before written upon. A chapter
in this volume is contributed by Mr. Hugh Phillips,
whose special studies concerning this little known
field enable him to present much valuable information
which has never before been in print, together
with illustrations of chintzes actually taken from
authentic examples of old furniture.</p>

<p>A brief survey is made of miscellaneous articles
associated with cottage and farmhouse furniture.
Some specimens of Sussex firebacks are illustrated,
together with fenders, firedogs, pot-hooks, candle-holders,
and brass and copper candlesticks.</p>

<p>The illustrations have been selected in order to
convey a broad outline of the subject. My especial
thanks are due to Messrs. Phillips, of the Manor
House, Hitchin, for placing at my disposal the
practical experience of many years' collecting in
various parts of the country, and by enriching the
volume with illustrations of many fine examples of
great importance and rarity never before photographed.</p>

<p>To Messrs. A. B. Daniell &amp; Sons I am indebted
for photographs of specimens in their galleries.</p>

<p>In presenting this volume it is my intention that
it should be a companion volume to my "Chats on
Old Furniture," which records the history and</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
evolution of the finer styles of English furniture,
showing the various foreign influences on English
craftsmen who made furniture for the wealthy
classes.</p>

traditional character of his work&mdash;Difficulty
to establish dates to cottage and farmhouse furniture&mdash;Oak
the chief wood employed&mdash;Beech, elm, and

need for the preservation and exhibition of old cottages
and farmhouses in Great Britain.</p>

<p>In regard to launching another volume on the market
dealing with old furniture, a word of explanation is
desirable, for nowadays of making books there is no
end, and much study is a weariness to the collector.</p>

<p>In the present volume attention has been especially
given to that class of furniture known as Cottage
or Farmhouse. There is no volume dealing with this
phase of collecting. Prices for old furniture of the
finest quality have gone up by leaps and bounds,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
and for those not possessed of ample means the
collection of superlative styles is at an end. Singularly
enough, the most native furniture and that
most typically racy of the soil has not hitherto
attracted the attention of wealthy collectors. The
plutocrats who buy only the finest creations of
Chippendale, who have immediate private information
when an exquisitely designed Sheraton piece
is found, who amass a mighty hoard of gilt Stuart
furniture, or who boast of an unrivalled collection
of Elizabethan oak, do not touch the minor furniture
made during a period of three hundred years for the
common people.</p>

<p>The finest classes of English furniture made by
skilful craftsmen for wealthy patrons must always
be beyond the range of the minor collector. Every
year brings keener zest among those interested in
furniture of a bygone day, and it is therefore increasingly
difficult for persons of taste and judgment
who cannot afford high prices to satisfy their longings.
It is obvious that specimens of massive
appearance finely carved in oak of the Tudor age,
or of elegantly turned work in walnut of Jacobean
days, must be readily recognised as valuable. Sumptuous
furniture tells its own story. It is unlikely
nowadays that such wonderful "finds," concerning
which imaginative writers are always telling us, will
occur again&mdash;except on paper. Popular enthusiasm
has been awakened, and more often than not the
possessor of some mediocre piece of furniture or
china attaches a value to it which is absurd. The
publication of prices realised at auction has whetted
<a id="Page_29"></a>
<a id="Page_30"></a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
the cupidity of would-be sellers who convert early
nineteenth-century chairs by a nod of the head into
"Queen Anne," and who aver with equal veracity
that ordinary blue transfer printed ware has "been
in the family a hundred years."</p>

</div></div>

<p>Cottage and farmhouse furniture may be said to
be in somewhat parallel case to English earthenware.
A quarter of a century ago, or even ten years ago,
collectors in general confined their attention mainly
to porcelain. The rage was for Worcester, Chelsea,
Derby, or Bow. With the exception of Wedgwood
and Turner, the Staffordshire potters had not found
favour with the fashionable collector. Nowadays
Toft dishes, Staffordshire figures by Enoch Wood,
vases by Neale and Palmer, and the entire school
of lustre ware, have received attention from the
specialist, and scientific classification has brought
prices within measurable distance of those paid for
porcelain.</p>

<p>What earthenware is to porcelain, so cottage and
farmhouse furniture are to the elaborate styles
made for the use of the richer classes. The French
insipidities and rococo ornament of Chelsea and
Derby and the oriental echoes of Worcester and of
Bow are as little typical of national eighteenth-century
sentiment as the ribbon-back chair and the
Chinese fretwork of Chippendale or the satinwood
elegances of Sheraton.</p>

<p>To Staffordshire and to local potteries scattered
all over the country from Sunderland to Bristol,
from Lambeth to Nottingham, from Liverpool to
Rye, one instinctively turns for real individuality
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
and native tradition. Similarly farmhouse furniture
exhibits the work of the local cabinet-maker in
various districts, strongly marked by an adherence
to traditional forms and intensely insular in its
disregard of prevailing fashions. It is as English
as the leather black-jack and the home-brewed ale.</p>

<p>Contemporaneous with the great cabinet-makers
who drew their inspiration from foreign sources&mdash;from
Italy, from France, from Holland, and from
Spain&mdash;small jobbing cabinet-makers in every village
and town had their patrons, and when not making
wagons or farm implements, produced furniture for
everyday use. As may readily be supposed, there
is in these results a blind naïveté which characterises
a design handed down from generation to generation.
This is one of the surprising features of the village
cabinet-maker's work&mdash;its curious anachronism. The
sublime indifference to passing fashions is astonishingly
delightful to the student and to the collector.</p>

<p>There is nothing more uncertain than to attempt
with exactitude to place a date upon cottage or
farmhouse furniture. The bacon-cupboard, the linen-chest,
the gate-table, the ladder-back chair and the
windsor chair, were made through successive generations
down to fifty years ago without departing from
the original pattern of the Charles I. or the Queen
Anne period. Oak chests are found carved with the
Gothic linen-fold pattern. They might be of the
sixteenth century except for the fact that dates of
the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century are
carved upon them. Whole districts have retained
similar styles for centuries, and the fondness for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
clearly defined types is almost as pronounced as that
of the Asiatic rug-weaver, who makes the same
patterns as his remote ancestors sold to the ancient
Greeks.</p>

<p>The village cabinet-maker's work knows no sequence
of ages of oak, walnut, mahogany, and satinwood.
His wood is from his native trees. His
chairs come straight from the hedgerows. His history
can be spanned in one long age of oak, intermingled
here and there with elm and yew-tree and beech.
The early days of primitive work go back to the
marked class distinction between gentles and simples,
and the end came only in the last decades of the
nineteenth century, when the village craftsman was
obliterated by the rapid advance of factory and
machine made furniture.</p>

<p>It may at first be assumed by the beginner that
cottage and farmhouse furniture is throughout a weak
and feeble imitation of finer pieces. But this is not
so. The craftsmen who made this class of furniture
formed for themselves special types which were never
made by the London cabinet-makers. For instance,
the Jacobean gate-table, the Lancashire wardrobe,
the dresser, and the windsor chair, have styles
peculiarly their own. In many of the specimens
found it will be seen that the village cabinet-maker
displayed very fine workmanship, and there are
clever touches and delightful mannerisms which
make such pieces of interest to the collector.</p>

<p>In early days of the villeins, furniture was limited
to a stool, a table, and perhaps a chest. Nor was
the use of much furniture at the farm or in the cottage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
a feature in Tudor and early Stuart days. Gorgeously
carved oak and richly turned walnut filled the
mansions of the wealthy, but one does not find its
simpler counterpart made for cottages till nearly 1660.
The few pieces essential to every dwelling-house may
be placed not earlier than the late sixteenth or early
seventeenth century&mdash;the chest, the table, the form,
and the Protestant Bible-box.</p>

<p>Chests with scratched Gothic mouldings, tables of
the trestle type as used to-day, forms of the most
simple construction, exist, and may be said to belong
to the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>Bible-boxes became common during the early
seventeenth century, and without change in their
style were made till the late eighteenth century. In
mid-seventeenth-century days the well-known gate-table
was introduced.</p>

<p>Of early pieces we illustrate a few examples,
though in connection with farmhouse and cottage,
the early days afford a poor field, as the furniture of
those days now remaining was mostly made for great
families. The two sixteenth-century chests illustrated
(p. <a href="#Page_31">29</a>) are interesting as showing the early
styles. The upper photograph is of a middle sixteenth-century
chest, with Gothic carving and solid
wood ends forming feet. This type of chest is made
from six boards. The hand-forged nails show the
rough joinery, and the large lock is characteristic of
such Gothic chests. The lower chest is also of the sixteenth
century. It has lozenge panels, and is further
ornamented by disc turning. The Gothic brackets
at the base are rare, and it is an interesting example.</p>

</div></div>

<p><a id="Page_36"></a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
That the chest remained in somewhat primitive
form is shown by the illustration of a seventeenth-century
specimen (p. <a href="#Page_35">35</a>). It will be observed that
the panels have early scratched mouldings, that is to
say they are not mitred. The fashion of mitreing in
cabinet-work came into general use about the year
1600, but minor examples of country furniture often
possess scratched moulding at a much later date.</p>

<p>On the same page is an Elizabethan chair. This
type is of exceptional interest. It has a long and
proud history. They are, according to Mr. Percy
Macquoid, "of Byzantine origin; their pattern was
introduced by the Varangian Guard into Scandinavia,
and from there doubtless brought to England by the
Normans. They continued to be made until the end of
the sixteenth century." These turned chairs are interesting
as having spindles, which came into use at a
much later period in the spindle-back chair.</p>

<p>With the growth of prosperity and the increased
use of domestic comforts, cottage furniture becomes
a wider subject. Carved oak bedsteads, simple four-posters,
bacon-cupboards, linen-chests became more
common. In eighteenth-century days there was
quite an outburst of enthusiasm, and the small
cabinet-maker gained knowledge of his craft and
became ambitious. On the promulgation of Chippendale's
designs he made copies in elm and oak and
beech for village patrons and essayed to follow
Hepplewhite and even Sheraton.</p>

<p>But this wave of success was followed by the competitive
inroad made by factory-made cabinet-work,
and during these last days the local cabinet-maker
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
adhered closer than ever to the early oak examples
of his forefathers. The village craft practically came
to an end in the fifties, but it was a glorious end, and
it is happy that it did not survive to produce bad
work of atrocious design.</p>

<p>The passing of cottage and farmhouse furniture
may be said to be like the disappearance of dialect.
The modern spirit has entered into village life, the
town newspaper has permeated the country-side and
disturbed the old-world repose. The lover of English
folk-ways and the simplicity of rural life may echo
the line of Wordsworth, "The things that I have
seen I now can see no more."</p>

<p>In the illustrations of two interiors shown on
p. <a href="#Page_41">39</a> it will be seen how happily placed the furniture
becomes when in its old home. The atmosphere
of these rural homesteads is at once soothing and
restful, and the pieces of furniture had an added
dignity. It seems almost sacrilege to tear such
relics of bygone days from their ancient resting-place.
But the collector is abroad, and few sanctuaries
have escaped his assiduous attention. The
lower illustration shows the interior of a cottage with
its original panelled walls. This cottage actually has
Tudor frescoes.</p>

<p>The study of old farmhouse and cottage furniture
has not been pursued in this country in so scientific
a manner as in Sweden and in Denmark. The conservation
of national heirlooms is a matter which
must be speedily dealt with before they become
scattered. It is a point which cannot be repeated too
often. At Skansen, Stockholm, old buildings have,
<a id="Page_39"></a>
<a id="Page_40"></a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
under State supervision, been re-erected, and with
their furniture they afford a practical illustration of
the particular type of life of the district of their
origin. At Lyngby, near Copenhagen, a series of
farmhouses similarly illustrate old types of homesteads
from various localities in Denmark, and from
Iceland and the Faroe Islands.</p>

</div></div>

<p>By such a systematic and permanent record of
farm and cottage life and the everyday art of the
people it is possible to impart vitality to the study of
the subject.</p>

<p>The English method of museum arrangement in
dry-as-dust manner, with rows of furniture and cases
of china, is a valley of dry bones compared with such
a fresh and vigorous handling and method of exposition
as is followed in Scandinavia.</p>

<p>If old English furniture is worth the preservation
for the benefit of students of craftsmanship or as a
relic of bygone customs, there is undoubted room
for due consideration of the best means of exhibiting
it. A series of representative farmhouses could be
re-erected at some convenient spot. There are many
parks around London and other great cities which
would be benefited by such picturesque buildings.</p>

<p>Before it is too late, and many of these beautiful
structures have been destroyed to make room for
modern improvements, and village life has become
absorbed by the growing towns, it should be possible
to step in and preserve some of the most typical
examples for the enjoyment of the nation. The
real interest shown by the public in out-of-door
object-lessons of this nature is indicated by the great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
crowds at Exhibitions at Earl's Court and the like,
which flocked to Tudor houses replete with old
furniture, and villages transplanted in lath and
plaster to simulate the real thing, which seemingly
has been neglected from an educational point of
view.</p>

<p>The mountain farms and the homesteads of the
men of the dales, fen farms, and stone cottages from
the Cotswolds, half-timbered farms from Surrey,
from Cheshire, and from Hampshire, dating back
to early Stuart days&mdash;are not these worthy of preservation?
In the Welsh hills, and nestling in the
dips of the Grampians and the Cheviots, from Wessex
to Northumbria, from the Border country to
the extremity of Cornwall, from East Anglia to the
Lakes, are treasures upon which the ruthless hand
of destruction must shortly fall. Or far afield in
Harris and in Skye, or remote Connemara, there
are types which should find a permanent abiding
place as national records of the homes of the men
of the island kingdom.</p>

<p>This should not be an impossible nor unthinkable
problem to solve before such are allowed to pass
away. The intense value of such a faithful record is
worthy of careful consideration by the authorities,
either as a national undertaking or under the auspices
of one of the learned societies, such as the Society of
Antiquaries, or the Society for the Protection of
Ancient Buildings and Monuments, interested in the
safeguarding of the national heritage bequeathed us
by our forefathers.</p>

<p class="hanging2">Typical Jacobean furniture&mdash;Solidity of English joiners'
work&mdash;Oak general in its use&mdash;The oak forests of
England&mdash;Sturdy independence of country furniture&mdash;Chests
of drawers&mdash;The slow assimilation of
foreign styles&mdash;The changing habits of the people.</p>

<p>To the lover of old oak, varied in character and
essentially English in its practical realisation of the
exact needs of its users, the seventeenth century
provides an exceptionally fine field. The chairs,
the tables, the dower-chests and the four-post bedsteads
of the farmhouse were sturdy reflections of
sumptuous furniture made for the nobility and
gentry in Jacobean and Elizabethan times. The
designs may have been suggested by finer and early
models, but the balance, the sense of proportion, and
the carving, were the result of the village carpenter's
own individual ideas as to the requirements of the
furniture for use in the farmhouse. Obviously
strength and stability were important factors, and
ornament, as such, took a subsidiary place in his
scheme. But, although coarse and possessing a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
leaning towards the unwieldy, and often massive
without the accompanying grandeur of the highly-trained
craftsman's work, there is a breadth of
treatment in such pieces which is at once recognisable.
They were made for use and no little thought was
bestowed on their lines, and, rightly appreciated,
they possess a considerable beauty. There is nothing
finicking about this seventeenth-century farmhouse
furniture. There is no meaningless ornament. Produced
in conditions suitable for quiet and restrained
craftsmanship, contemplative cabinet-makers began
to evolve styles that are far removed from the
average design of furniture made to-day under more
pretentious surroundings.</p>

<p>The gate table, with its long history and its
amplification of structure and ornament, to which a
separate chapter is devoted (Chapter III), is a case
in point. It was extensively used in inns and in
farmhouses and found itself in set definite types
spread over a wide area from one end of the country
to the other. Its practicability caught the taste
of lovers of utility. Its added gracefulness of form,
in combination with its adaptability to modern needs,
has recaptured the fancy of housewives to-day. It
is the happy survival of a beautiful and useful piece
of ingenious cabinet-work.</p>

<p>To-day one finds unexpectedly a London fashion
lingering in the provinces years afterwards. A stray
air from a light opera or some catch-phrase of town
slang is gaily bandied about as current coin in
bucolic jest long after its circulation in the metropolis
has ceased. The fashions in provincial furniture
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
moved as slowly. Half a century after certain styles
were the vogue they crept imperceptibly into country
use. In speech and song the transplantation is
more rapid, but in craftsmanship, the studied work
of men's hands, the use of novelty is against the
grain of the conservative mind of the country
cabinet-maker. Therefore throughout the entire
field of this minor furniture it must be borne in
mind that it is quite usual to find examples of one
century reflecting the glories of the period long
since gone.</p>

<p><b>Solidity of English Joiners' Work.</b>&mdash;The love of old
country furniture of the seventeenth century is
hardly an acquired taste. Old oak is at once a
jarring note in a Sheraton drawing-room with
delicate colour scheme of dainty wallpaper and
satin coverings. But as a general rule, when it is
first seen in its proper environment, in an old-world
farmhouse with panelled walls, and mullioned
windows, set squarely on an oak floor and beneath
blackened oak beams ripe with age, it wins immediate
recognition as representative of a fine period of
furniture. It is admitted by experts, and it is the
proud boast of possessors of old oak, that the joiner's
work of this style&mdash;the seventeenth century at its
best&mdash;stands unequalled for its solidity and sound
practical adhesion to fixed principles governing
sturdy furniture fashioned for hard and continued
usage. Of course, there were no screws used in
those days, and little glue. The joints dovetailed
into each other with great exactness and were
fastened by the wooden pins so often visible in old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
examples. The modern copyist has a fine regard
for these wooden pegs. He knows that his clients
set store by them, and he accordingly sees to it that
they are well in evidence in his replicas. But there
is yet a distinction which may be noticed between
his pegs and the originals. His are accurately round,
turned by machinery to fit an equally circular
machine-turned hole. They tell their own story
instantly to a trained eye, to say nothing of the
piece of furniture as a whole, which always has little
conflicting touches to denote its modernity.</p>

<p>As an instance of the form of the sixteenth century
continuing in use until mid-seventeenth-century days
the illustration of an oak table (p. <a href="#Page_59">63</a>) brings out
this point. The heavy baluster-like legs, only just
removed from the earlier bulbous types, and the
massive treatment belong to the days of James I.,
and yet such pieces really were made in Cromwellian
days.</p>

<p>The rude simplicity of much of the farmhouse
furniture is indicated by the Monk's Bench illustrated
(p. <a href="#Page_55">53</a>). The back is convertible into a table top.
The early plainness of style for so late a piece as
1650 is particularly noteworthy. This specimen is
interesting by reason of its exceptionally large back.</p>

<p>On the same page is illustrated a chest with two
drawers underneath. This form is termed a "Mule
Chest," and is the earliest form of the chest of
drawers. These Cromwellian chests with drawers
continued to be made in the country for a hundred
years, but in more fashionable circles they soon
developed into the well-known Jacobean chest of
<a id="Page_53"></a>
<a id="Page_54"></a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
drawers, the prototype of the form in use to-day.
As an instance of this lingering of fashion the chest
illustrated is dated 1701, quite fifty years after its
first appearance as a new style.</p>

<p><b>Oak General in its Use.</b>&mdash;The oak as a wood was in
general use both in the furniture of the richer classes
and in the farmhouse furniture of seventeenth-century
days and earlier. Inlaid work is unknown in furniture
of this type. It was sparingly used in pieces of
more important origin. The room shown at the
Victoria and Albert Museum from Sizergh Castle
has inlays of holly and bog oak. And the suite of
furniture at Hardwicke Hall made for Bess of Hardwicke
was made by English workmen who had been
in Italy, the same persons who produced similar
work at Longleat. Small panels with rough inlaid
work are not uncommon in the seventeenth century
in chests, bedsteads, and drawers. But the prevailing
types of oak without the added inlays of other
woods were rigidly adhered to in cabinet-makers'
work for the farmhouse.</p>

<p>The great oak forests, such as Sherwood, furnished
an abundance of timber for all domestic purposes,
and up to the seventeenth century little other wood
was used for any structural or artistic purpose.
Practically oak may be considered as the national
wood. From the <i>Harry Grâce à Dieu</i> of Henry VIII.
and the <i>Golden Hind</i> of Drake to the <i>Victory</i> of
Nelson, the great ships were of English oak. The
magnificent hammer-beam roof of Westminster Hall
is of the same wonderful wood. All over the country
are scattered buildings timbered with oak beams,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
from cathedrals and ancient churches to farmhouses
and mills. The oak piles of old London Bridge were
taken up after six centuries and a half and found to
be still sound at the heart. The mass of furniture of
nearly three centuries ago has survived owing to the
durability of its wood. To this day English oak
commands great esteem, although foreign oak has
taken its place in the general timber trade, yet there
is none which possesses such strong and lasting
qualities. It will stand a strain of 1,900 lbs. per
square inch transversely to its fibres.</p>

<p><b>Sturdy Independence of Country Furniture.</b>&mdash;The
hardness of the oak as a wood is one of the factors
which determined the styles of decoration of the
furniture into which it was fashioned. It was not
easily capable of intricate carved work, even in
the hands of accomplished craftsmen. The fantastic
flower and fruit pieces of Grinling Gibbons and other
carvers were in lime or chestnut, and the age of
walnut, a more pliant and softer wood to work in
than oak, was yet to come. The country maker,
little versed in the subtleties of cabinet-work, contented
himself with a narrow range of types, which
lasted over a considerable period. This is especially
noticeable in his chairs, and specimens are found of
the same form as the middle seventeenth century
belonging to the last decade of the eighteenth
century.</p>

<p>The typical sideboard of the seventeenth century
only varies slightly in form according to the part
of the country from which it comes. The general
design is always permanent. A large cupboard
<a id="Page_57"></a>
<a id="Page_58"></a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
below, two smaller ones above, set somewhat back
from the front of the lower one, the sides of the
upper ones sometimes canted off, leaving two triangular
spaces of flat top at the ends of the bottom
one. The whole is surmounted by a top shelf, supported
by the upper cupboards and two boldly turned
pillars. This is usually the design. The decoration
is of the simplest, and presents nothing beyond the
powers of the village carpenter. The mouldings are
simple; there is slight conventional carving, frequently
consisting of hollow flutings, and the pillars, boldly
turned, are very rarely enriched by any ornament. A
careful examination of such pieces is always interesting
from a technical point of view. The framing of
the panels is seen to be worked out by the plane, but
the panels themselves more often than not have been
reduced to approximate flatness with an adze. If
viewed in a side light the surface is thus slightly
varied, showing the differences in the planes of the
various facets produced by the adze and giving an
effect entirely different from the mechanical smoothing
of a surface by the use of a plane.</p>

<p>The framing of the front and ends of these sideboards
is in detail exactly like the ordinary Jacobean
wall panelling or wainscot. The mouldings are all
worked on the rails or styles, not mitred and glued
on, no mitred mouldings being used except occasionally
in the centre panel between the doors. The
framing is mortised together and pinned with oak
pins. The doors are usually hung on iron strap
hinges, and the handles of the doors are of wrought
iron. Frequently the doors of the upper cupboards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
are hung on pivots, not hinges. Such a sideboard
belongs to the middle period of the seventeenth
century, and is representative of a wide class used
in farmhouses.</p>

<p>It is easier to follow the various movements in
the design of the seventeenth-century table than a
century later, when more complex circumstances
governed its use. The illustrations on p. <a href="#Page_59">57</a> give
early forms, with some suggestion as to the progression
in design.</p>

<p>The early oak Table is a curious compound of
design. It has retained the Elizabethan bulbous form
of leg and has the Cromwellian foot. In date the piece
is about 1640. The brass handle has been added later.</p>

<p>The Joint Stools on the lower half of the page
afford a picture of slowly advancing invention in
turned work. The one on the left of the group is
the earliest, and is about 1640 in date. Its legs are
seen to be of coarser work, roughly turned, but
typically early Jacobean in breadth of treatment.
The two on the right are about 1660 in date. The
left-hand one shows the urn-shaped leg of the strong,
broad treatment (as in the Table illustrated p. <a href="#Page_59">63</a>),
brought into subjection and exhibiting a gracefulness
of form and balance that make furniture of this type
so lovable. The smaller stool shows the ball-carving
associated with the Restoration period, and found in
gate tables. A combination of these styles of turning
is shown in the graceful oak Table illustrated
p. <a href="#Page_67">65</a>, in date about 1680.</p>

<p><b>Chests of Drawers.</b>&mdash;The conservative spirit of the
minor craftsmen is especially noticeable in the articles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
of everyday use. The merchant's account ledger
with its green back and cross-stitched pattern in
vellum strips, still in use, is to be found in the same
style in Holbein pictures of the days of the Hanseatic
League. Brass and copper candlesticks have a long
lineage, and their form is only a slight variant from
very early examples. The evolution of ornament is
especially interesting; the old stoneware Bellarmine
form still remains in the bearded mask at the lip
of china jugs at the beginning of the nineteenth
century. The two buttons at the back of the coattails
continue long after their primary use to loop up
the sword-belt has vanished.</p>

<p>In America the early carved chests of the Puritan
colonists were followed by similar designs contemporary
with our own Jacobean style for a period
well towards the end of the seventeenth century.
The panels on chairs and chests have the same
arcaded designs as found in Elizabethan bedsteads
and fireplaces. These become gradually crystallised
in conventional form, and Lockwood, the American
writer on old colonial furniture, has reduced the types
coincident with our own Jacobean styles into ten
distinct patterns, until the advent of the well-known
chests of drawers with geometric raised ornament
laid on, which pieces of furniture in Restoration days
were set upon a stand.</p>

<p>We have shown in the illustration (p. <a href="#Page_55">53</a>) the
earliest form of the chest with drawers underneath.
The stage transitional between this and the multifarious
designs with bevelled panels in geometric
design is exemplified by the chest, in date about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
1660, illustrated (p. <a href="#Page_67">63</a>), having two drawers and a
centre bevelled panel, and with two arcaded panels
on each side of this and also arcaded panels at the
ends of the chest. This form was rapidly succeeded
by the well-known chests of drawers on ball feet or
on stand so much appreciated by collectors.</p>

<p>We illustrate a sufficient number of pieces to
cover the usual styles and to assist the beginner to
identify examples coming under his observation.
Although it should be noted that as these chests of
drawers are so much sought after they are manufactured
nowadays by the hundred and out of old
wood, so that great care should be exercised in
paying big prices for them unless under expert
guidance.</p>

<p>The specimen appearing on p. <a href="#Page_67">65</a> is a fine
example, in date 1660, and when the ball feet are
original, as in this example, the genuineness of the
chest of drawers is undoubted. Too often stands or
feet are added, and it is exceedingly rare to find that
the brass handles are original. Quite an industry is
carried on in reproducing old brass escutcheons and
handles from rare designs and carefully imparting to
them signs of age, so that they may be used in
made-up chests of drawers and tables.</p>

<p>Of types of stands, the two chests of drawers
illustrated p. <a href="#Page_71">69</a> are fair examples. The upper
chest is a curious Jacobean type with sunk panels and
having an unusually high stand. There is a suggestion
that this has been added later, as the foot is
eighteenth-century in character.</p>

<p>The lower chest is of the Charles II. type with
<a id="Page_63"></a>
<a id="Page_64"></a>
<a id="Page_65"></a>
<a id="Page_66"></a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
sunk panels and having the arcaded foot of that
period. It will be observed that in addition to the
four drawers it has a drawer at the bottom.</p>

<p>The treatment of the stand or legs of these chests
exercised the ingenuity of various generations of
cabinet-makers. In the specimen illustrated p. <a href="#Page_71">69</a>,
the eighteenth century is reached. The transition
from passing Jacobean styles into those of Queen
Anne is clearly seen. The bevelled panels still
remain, with added geometric intricacies of design,
and a new feature appears in the fluted sides. But
the most interesting feature is the cabriole leg, so
definitely indicative of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p><b>The Slow Assimilation of Foreign Styles in Furniture.</b>&mdash;Farmhouse
furniture almost eschewed fashion. In
seventeenth-century days it pursued the even tenor
of its way untrammelled by town influences. England
in those days was not traversed by roads that
lent themselves to neighbourly communication. A
hundred years later Wedgwood found the wretched
roads in Staffordshire, where waggons sunk axle-deep
in ruts and pits, a hindrance to his business,
and William Cobbett in his <i>Rural Rides</i> leaves a
record of Surrey woefully primitive at Hindhead,
with dangerous hills and bogs, where the "horses
took the lead and crept down, partly upon their feet
and partly upon their hocks."</p>

<p>From the days of James I. to those of James II.,
from the first Stuart Sovereign to the last of that ill-starred
house, the country passed through rapid
stages of volcanic history. The opening years of the
century saw the colonisation of Ulster by the Scots
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
and the English settlers, and the sailing of the <i>Mayflower</i>
and the foundation of New England by the
Puritans, nine years after the publication of the
Authorised version of the Bible. Under Charles I.
came the struggle between the despotic power of the
Crown and the newly awakened will of the people.
Parliamentary right came into conflict with royal prerogative.
The smouldering fire burst into flame when
John Hampden, a country gentleman, refused to pay
Ship Money, which was levied on the inland counties
in 1637, and the arrest of five members of Parliament
in 1642&mdash;Hampden, Pym, Holles, Haselrig, and
Strode&mdash;precipitated the country into civil war.</p>

<p>For seven years a continual series of battles were
waged by the contending forces. The Eastern
Counties formed themselves into a martial association,
and the King set up his standard at Nottingham.
From Bristol to Hull and from Nantwich to Newbury
fierce engagements tore the country asunder.
An Irish army was raised for the King, and the Scots
under Leslie crossed the border in the Parliamentarian
cause. With the execution of Charles I.
came other dangers; the sword was not sheathed,
nor had revolution left a contented country-side.
Cromwell divided the kingdom into eleven military
districts, and under his rule England took her place
at the head of the Protestant States in Europe.</p>

<p>With the death of the Protector and the restoration
of the Stuarts, when Charles II. returned home,
came an influx of foreign customs and foreign arts
learned by expelled royalists in their enforced
sojourn on the Continent. London and the Court
<a id="Page_69"></a>
<a id="Page_70"></a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
instantly became the centre of voluptuous fashion.
The pages of Pepys's <i>Diary</i> afford instructive pictures
of the last quarter of the century at Whitehall with
the Merry Monarch exhibited in vivid colours, and
more intimate still are the word-portraits cleverly
etched by the Count de Grammont in his <i>Memoirs</i>
of the gay circle at Court. And after Charles came
his brother James, nor were civil strife and Court
intrigue memories of the past. Restlessness still
characterises the closing years of the century. The
insurrection of Monmouth in the West of England
was followed by the Bloody Assize of Judge Jeffreys.
The air is filled with trouble, and blundering statecraft
brings fresh disaster, culminating in the ignominious
flight of the King. Nor does this complete
the changing scenes of the seventeenth century. A
new era under William the Dutchman brought new
and permanent influences, and religious toleration
and constitutional government became firmly rooted
as the heritage of the people of this country.</p>

</div></div>

<p>It is essential that a rough idea of the period
be gained in order to appreciate the kaleidoscopic
character of the events that rapidly succeeded each
other. The paralysis of the arts during the civil
war had not a little influence on the furniture of the
period belonging to the class of which we treat in
this volume. The wealth of noble and patrician
families had been scattered, estates had been confiscated,
and sumptuous furniture and appointments
pillaged and destroyed, especially when it offended
the narrow tastes of the Puritan soldiery. Some of
the minor pieces no doubt found their way into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
humbler homes and served as models for simpler
folk. With a dearth of aristocratic patrons there
were no new art impulses to stir craftsmen to their
highest moods, but in spite of war and disturbances
affecting all classes, furniture for common use had
to be made, and the ready-found types exercised a
continued influence on all the earlier work.</p>

<p>In regard to farmhouse furniture the following
types represent in the main the seventeenth-century
styles: the bedstead, the sideboard or dresser,
the table and the chair in its various forms, the
Bible-box and the cradle. The Jacobean chest of
drawers, a development of the dower-chest, came in
mid-seventeenth-century days, and prior to the
William and Mary styles. The sideboard, a development
of the bacon-cupboard, came into fashion in
the middle of the century. It was a reflex of the
grander furniture of the manor house and the
nobleman's mansion. It is difficult to fix exact
dates to Jacobean furniture of this character. As
a general rule it is safer to place it at a later date
than is the usual custom.</p>

<p><b>The Changing Habits of the People.</b>&mdash;The shifting
phases of the restless seventeenth century make it
exceedingly difficult, in spite of experts, to decide
definitely as to the exact date of furniture. The
country being in such an unsettled state obviously
influenced the manufacture of domestic furniture.
Its natural evolution was broken and the restraint of
the Jacobean forms was in the main due to the
conditions prevailing in regard to their manufacture.
The long list of battles given in the chronological
<a id="Page_73"></a>
<a id="Page_74"></a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
table at the commencement of this chapter is
advisedly recorded to show the intense upheaval
which was caused by the civil wars which raged
from north to south, from east to west, and convulsed
any artistic impulses which may have been in process
of materialisation.</p>

<p>WILLIAM AND MARY TABLE. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C.</i> 1670.</p>
<p>With finely turned legs and stretcher and scalloped underwork.</p>
<p>(<i>By the courtesy of Messrs. Phillips, Hitchin.</i>)</p>
</div></div>

<p>It is obvious the class of Table of the William
and Mary period, in date about 1670, illustrated (p. <a href="#Page_75">73</a>),
with finely turned legs and stretcher and scalloped
underwork, belongs to a period far more advanced
in comfort than the days when such a table as that
illustrated p. <a href="#Page_67">63</a> was the ordinary type.</p>

<p>By the end of the century the growth of sea power
and the astonishing development of trade brought
corresponding domestic luxuries. The two children's
stools illustrated (p. <a href="#Page_79">77</a>) must have come from a
country squire's or wealthy provincial merchant's
house. Their upholstered seats emulate the grandeur
of finer types. The rare form of oak bedstead
illustrated on the same page is a survival of the
early type. In date this is about 1700; not too
often are such examples found, for enterprising
restorers and makers have seized these old Jacobean
bedsteads and converted them into so-called Jacobean
"sideboards," wherein nothing is old except the
wood.</p>

<p>It requires some little imagination to conjure up
what the daily meals were in the days of the early
Stuarts. There was the leather jack, the horn mug,
and the long table in the hall where the farmer and
his servants ate together. An old black-letter song,
entitled "When this old cap was new," in date 1666,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
in the Roxburgh "Songs and Ballads," has two verses
which paint a lively picture:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"Black-jacks to every man</div>
<div class="line i1h">  Were fill'd with wine and beer;</div>
<div class="line i0h">No pewter pot nor can</div>
<div class="line i1h">  In those days did appear;</div>
<div class="line i0h">Good cheer in a nobleman's house</div>
<div class="line i1h">  Was counted a seemly show;</div>
<div class="line i0h">We wanted not brawn nor souse</div>
<div class="line i1h">  When this old cap was new.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i0h">We took not such delight</div>
<div class="line i1h">  In cups of silver fine;</div>
<div class="line i0h">None under the degree of knight</div>
<div class="line i1h">  In plate drank beer or wine;</div>
<div class="line i0h">Now each mechanical man</div>
<div class="line i1h">  Hath a cupboard of plate for show,</div>
<div class="line i0h">Which was a rare thing then</div>
<div class="line i1h">  When this old cap was new."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The "mechanical man" is a delightful touch of
the old song-writer. We fear he would have been
shocked at the degeneracy of a later day, when in
place of the mug that was handed round came the
effeminate teacups. The change from ale, at breakfast
and dinner and supper, to tea the beverage of
the poor, would be a sad awakening from the ideals
set up by the rollicking song-writer of Restoration
days. But such innovations must needs be closely
regarded by the student of furniture.</p>

<p>We wish sometimes that historians had spared a
few pages from military evolutions and Court
intrigues to let us know what the parlours and
bedrooms of our ancestors looked like. A rough
résumé from Macaulay's "State of England in 1685,"

<p>At Enfield, hardly out of sight of the smoke of the
capital, was a region of five-and-twenty miles in
circumference, which contained only three houses
and scarcely any enclosed fields, where deer wandered
free in thousands. Red deer were as common in
Gloucestershire and Hampshire as they are now in
the Grampians. Queen Anne, travelling to Portsmouth,
on one occasion, saw a herd of no less than
five hundred.</p>

<p>Agriculture was not a greatly known science.
The rotation of crops was imperfectly understood.
The turnip had just been introduced to this country,
but it was not the practice to feed sheep and oxen
with this in the winter. They were killed and salted
at the beginning of the cold weather, and during
several months even the gentry tasted little fresh
animal food except game and river fish. In the
days of Charles II. it was at the beginning of
November that families laid in their stock of salt
provisions, then called Martinmas beef.</p>

<p>The state of the roads in those days was somewhat
barbarous. Ruts were deep, descents precipitous,
and the way often difficult to distinguish in
the dusk from the unenclosed fen and heath on each
side. Pepys and his wife, travelling in their own
coach, lost their way between Newbury and Reading.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
In some parts of Kent and Sussex none but the
strongest horses could, in winter, get through the
bog in which they sank deep at every step. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
coaches were often pulled by oxen.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> When Prince
George of Denmark visited the mansion of Petworth
he was six hours travelling nine miles. Throughout
the country north of York and west of Exeter goods
were carried by long trains of packhorses.</p>

<p>The capital was a place far removed from the
country. It was seldom that the country squire paid
a visit thither. "Towards London and Londoners
he felt an aversion that more than once produced
important political effects" (Macaulay). Apart from
the country gentlemen were the petty proprietors who
cultivated their own fields with their own hands and
enjoyed a modest competence without affecting to
have scutcheons and crests. This great class of yeomanry
formed a much more important part of the
nation than now. According to the most reliable
statistics of the seventeenth century, there were no
less than a hundred and sixty thousand proprietors,
who with their families made a seventh of the population
of those days, and these derived their livelihood
from small freehold estates.</p>

<p>Such, then, were the chief differences dividing the
life of the country from the life of the town. The
London merchants had town mansions hardly less
inferior to the nobility. Chelsea was a quiet village
with a thousand inhabitants, and sportsmen with dog
and gun wandered over Marylebone. General Oglethorpe,
who died in 1785, used to boast that he had
shot a woodcock in what is now Regent Street, in
Queen Anne's reign.</p>

<p>The days of the Stuarts were not so rosy as writers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
of romance have chosen to have us believe. At
Norwich, the centre of the cloth industry, children of
the tender age of six were engaged in labour. At
Bristol a labyrinth of narrow lanes, too narrow for
cart traffic, was built over vaults. Goods were conveyed
across the city in trucks drawn by dogs. Meat
was so dear that King, in his "Natural and Political
Conclusions," estimates that half the population of
the country only ate animal food twice a week, and
the other half only once a week or not at all. "Bread
such as is now given to the inmates of a workhouse
was then seldom seen even on the trencher of a
yeoman or a shopkeeper. The majority of the nation
lived almost entirely on rye, barley, and oats."</p>

<p>The change from these conditions to those we
associate with the eighteenth century was not a
sudden but a slow one. With the increase of average
prosperity came the additional requirements in household
furniture. It is impossible now to state accurately
what the exact furniture was of the various classes of
the community. Many of the seventeenth-century
pieces now remaining have been treasured in great
houses and belong to a variety which in those days
was regarded as sumptuous. Now and again we
catch glimpses of the former life of the men and
women of those days. Little pieces of conclusive
evidence are brought to light which enable safe conclusions
to be drawn. But the everyday normal
character has too often gone unrecorded. We are
left with Court memoirs, diaries of the great, literary
proofs of the more scholarly, but the simple annals of
the poor are, in the main, unrecorded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
In view of this series of queer and remarkable
facts strung together to afford the reader a rough
and ready picture of those dim days, one comes to
believe that much of the ordinary seventeenth-century
furniture must be regarded as having belonged to the
great yeoman class of the community. With this
belief the collector very rightly regards it of sterling
worth, as reminiscent of the men from whose sturdy
stock has sprung a great race.</p>

THE GATE-LEG<br />
TABLE</h2>

<p class="title1">CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="medium">THE GATE-LEG TABLE</span></p>

<p class="hanging2">Its early form&mdash;Transitional and experimental stages&mdash;Its
establishment as a permanent popular type&mdash;The
gate-leg table in the Jacobean period&mdash;Walnut and
mahogany varieties&mdash;Its utility and beauty contribute
to its long survival&mdash;Its adoption in modern
days.</p>

<p>The gate-leg table is always regarded with veneration
by collectors. It has a charm of style and beauty of
construction which afford never-ending delight to possessors
of old examples. It is an inspired piece of
cabinet-work which belongs to the middle of the
seventeenth century, and exhibits the supreme effort
of the early Jacobean craftsmen to break away from
the square massive tables, the lineal descendants of
the great bulbous-legged table of the Elizabethan
hall. Dining-tables with the device of slides to
draw out when occasion required, even in early
days became a necessity. It is a note indicating the
changing habits of the people. A table was no
longer used for one purpose. The large table required
a permanent place in a large room. But smaller
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
houses fitted with minor furniture had their limitations
of space, and so the ingenuity of a table that would
close together and stand against a wall, or could be
used as a round table for dining, was a welcome
innovation.</p>

<p><b>Its Early Form.</b>&mdash;The series of illustrations in this
chapter afford a fairly comprehensive survey of the
progress and differing character of the gate-leg table
during the hundred years that it held a place in
domestic furniture. It is difficult to say with exactitude
which are the earliest forms, or whether the
round table without the moving gates was a sort of
transitional form prior to the use of the movable legs.
It is quite possible that in his attempt to invent
something more convenient than the heavy square
dining-table the progressive cabinet-maker of the
middle seventeenth century did strike the half-way
form. But on the other hand it must be admitted
that there is the possibility that the gate-leg
table came first, and that the types with three legs and
half circular tops stand by themselves as later types.
On the whole, one is inclined to the belief, especially
as it prettily illustrates forms of natural evolution,
that the three-legged table with fixed legs and half
round top came first.</p>

<p>The two tables illustrated on p. <a href="#Page_89">87</a> belong to
this three-legged type. The upper one is half circular
at the top and the three legs are stationary. This
particular table is in date about 1660, and although
in this instance it is obviously later than other forms
we illustrate having gate-legs, yet by the theory we
have advanced above, it belongs to a type prior to the
<a id="Page_87"></a>
<a id="Page_88"></a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
use of a gate. The lower one is a fine example, in date
about 1640, of a triangular gate-leg table. The top
is round, and the illustration shows the gate open at
right angles to the stretcher. The arcaded spandrils
are an interesting and rare feature.</p>

</div></div>

<p><b>Transitional Types.</b>&mdash;Not only is the feeling towards
the gradual establishment of this new form of table
shown in its construction, first with four legs until it
developed into a table with twelve legs and double
gates, but the styles of ornament used in the turning
differ greatly in character. The leg is capable of
wide and differing treatment. There is the urn leg, a
rare and early type, the ball turned leg, egg-and-reel
turned leg, and the straight leg. In regard to the
stretcher similar varieties occur. Sometimes it is
entirely plain, and when it is decoratively turned it
varies from the early survival of the Gothic trestle to
the rare cross stretcher of the late collapsible table.
In some types of Yorkshire tables the stretchers are
splat-form, like a ladder-back chair. The feet differ
in no less degree from the usual Jacobean type to
the scroll or Spanish foot at a later date. In the early
eighteenth century there is the interesting series of
Queen Anne flap tables which have gate-legs. Some
have the bottom stretcher to the gate-leg. These
belong to the walnut period, when a greater vivacity
became noticeable in English cabinet work.</p>

<p>It is this picturesque and endless stream of designs
which appeals to the collector. It is quite worthy of
study to follow the difference in the cabinet-work of
these gate tables. The long line of craftsmen who
fashioned them added here and there not only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
touches of ornament that were personal, but invented
details of construction as improvements to existing
forms.</p>

<p>A very early type with urn legs and having plain
gates is that illustrated p. <a href="#Page_95">91</a>. It is small in size
and belongs to the first half of the seventeenth
century. The survival of the Gothic trestle feet of an
earlier type is noteworthy. The table on the same
page has the trestle ends still retained. There is still
the single leg at each end, as in the example above.
The gates are square and plain and the legs are ball
turned, a combination representing an early type.
The size of this piece is small and its date is about
1650 or somewhat later.</p>

<p><b>Its Establishment as a Popular Type.</b>&mdash;The varied
improvements and the slightly differing characteristics
make it perfectly clear, when examined in detail,
that the gate table in various parts of the country
had firmly established itself and had won popular
approval as a permanent type. In the search for
tables of this form, however wide the net is spread by
those indefatigable seekers in out-of-the-way places,
and by the small army of trade collectors who scour
the country for the purpose of unearthing something
rare and unique, the story is always the same. In
the most remote districts such tables are still found:
the growth of the use of this gate-leg form permeated
every part of the country. It was copied and recopied,
native touches were added, and the old
leading lines followed by generation after generation
of craftsmen. It had as great a vogue during the
long period of its history as the styles of Chippendale
<a id="Page_91"></a>
<a id="Page_92"></a>
<a id="Page_93"></a>
<a id="Page_94"></a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
chairs had at a later date, when every country
cabinet-maker was seized with the desire to produce
minor Chippendale in oak or beech or elm.</p>

</div></div>

<p><b>The Jacobean Period.</b>&mdash;Essentially the flower of the
popular creations of the Jacobean furniture-designer,
the gate table must always stand as reminiscent of
the days of Charles I. and Charles II. No picture
of this period is considered artistically complete
unless there be a gate-leg table with its picturesque
lines adding a technical touch of correctness to
interiors. The portrait of Herrick, the parson-poet of
Devon, imaginative though it be, whenever it appears
on canvas or illustrating his lyrics, shows the poet
beside a fine gate-leg table. Stage tradition is
equally sure on the same point. A company of
swaggering cavaliers at an inn is not complete without
a group arranged at one of these tables quaffing
wine from flagons.</p>

<p>Without doubt the finest examples are to be
found from the year 1660 to the end of the reign
of Charles II. A new impetus had been given to
furniture-making in Restoration days. The country
had settled down in tranquillity and the domestic
arts began again to thrive in natural manner following
the earlier motives of the days of Charles I. The
recent civil wars had arrested their development, and
now they burst forth again with renewed youth.</p>

<p>Ripe examples of the best period may be assigned
to the last three or four decades of the seventeenth
century. These, it should be explained, are in
oak. We illustrate (p. <a href="#Page_95">93</a>) a particularly pleasing
specimen with double gates which belongs to this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
finest period. There are, it will be observed, twelve
legs, and the stretchers are finely turned with what is
known as the egg-and-reel pattern. As a matter of
fact pieces such as this, on account of the rare form,
bring from £15 to £35, and they are rapidly being
gathered into the folds of collectors.</p>

<p>Another rare form is shown on the same page.
This, too, has double gates, and the stretchers are
similarly turned. There is only one flap to this table,
and it will be observed that it makes another variation
from accepted styles in having a rectangular
instead of a circular top. Tables with one flap are
always rare, and when found they usually have two
gates.</p>

<p>It will be seen that there are pleasant surprises in
following changing forms all through the period.
On p. <a href="#Page_103">97</a> a table is illustrated with two gates on one
stretcher. This in date is about 1660.</p>

<p>The table below, on the same page, exhibits florid
turning in the legs. The stretchers across the two
legs are half way up and are the Yorkshire form of
splat stretcher. This type is found as early as 1660
and as late as 1750.</p>

<p>The difference in structure is noticeable in two
tables shown on p. <a href="#Page_103">99</a>. The one has six legs and the
other eight legs. The first has finely turned legs
and stretchers in what is familiarly known as the
"barley-sugar" pattern. Among its exceptional
features are the legs being only six in number, the
gates being hinged to stretcher, two legs thus being
dispensed with, and the additional bar across the two
central stretchers. This is a rare piece and in date is

about 1670. The Gate Table on the same page with
eight legs is a good example of ball turning. This
is a type which survived well into the eighteenth
century.</p>

</div></div>

<p>As exhibiting two types as wide asunder as the
poles, and yet not far removed in point of time,
the two tables illustrated, p. <a href="#Page_103">101</a>, make a curious
contrast. The upper one, in date about 1660, is a
slender, graceful example, with the unusual <b>X</b>-shaped
stretcher. It will be seen from the illustration
that the two stretchers when closed fit flat with the
legs and the top flaps over, thus making the table
practically collapsible.</p>

<p>The lower Table, of late seventeenth or early
eighteenth century, is a somewhat primitive form,
with the gates at one end. This has obviously been
made by a local carpenter or wheelwright not conversant
with turning, as the shaping of the legs is
strongly suggestive of the rude fashioning of the
shafts of a farm wagon.</p>

<p><b>Walnut and Mahogany Varieties.</b>&mdash;As the mid-Jacobean
period is left behind, and walnut is the
chief wood used in ornamental turned work, so
the character of the gate table begins to incline
towards the technique more suitable to walnut than
to oak. The turning, more easily done in the former
wood, becomes more intricate. Hence some examples
appear which are practically types of the walnut age.
But, in general, the old gate-leg table is a survival
throughout the William and Mary and Queen Anne
periods, wherein country makers clung to the oak
form and employed oak still in its manufacture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
The William and Mary Gate Table illustrated
(p. <a href="#Page_107">105</a>) is constructed with one gate. It is small
in size, practically being an ornamental or occasional
table. It has a fine character, and the "barley sugar"
pattern is deeply turned. Side by side with this is a
small square-topped Gate Table with the pillar-leg,
denoting a reversion to early type. The stretcher is
of the old trestle form. Both these pieces, on account
of their small size and well-balanced construction,
show that considerable attention was being paid to
symmetry. Such specimens can readily be transplanted
to more modern surroundings, and yet in
some subtle manner harmonise with later furniture.</p>

<p>They share this peculiarity with objects of Oriental
art of the highest type. Old blue Nankin and old
lac cabinets, although anachronisms amid furniture
of a later date, possess the property of being in
sympathy with their new environment, much in the
same manner as an old Persian rug becomes a restful
acquisition in a luxurious Western home.</p>

<p>Some of the forms are so rare as to be almost
unique. It is seldom that so interesting a piece is
found as the Table illustrated (p. <a href="#Page_107">105</a>) with the
scroll feet in Spanish style. It has only one gate,
and the top of the table lifts up, forming a box. The
lock is shown at the front in the photograph. The
adjacent table has a corrupted form of the Spanish
foot, doubled under in cramped fashion like the flapper
of a seal. This also has one gate; in date this piece
is about 1680.</p>

<p>The days of mahogany, with Chippendale in his
prime and Hepplewhite, Ince and Mayhew, Robert
<a id="Page_105"></a>
<a id="Page_106"></a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
Manwaring, Matthias Lock, William Shearer, and a
crowd of others, brought intricate carving in mahogany
into intense prominence. This was the golden age
of furniture design. An outburst of enthusiasm,
following the architectural triumphs of the Brothers
Adam, wherein they raised interior decoration to a
level as high as that in France, had swept over the
country. In spite of the rich profusion of new design
being poured out in illustrated volumes and in
executed furniture, the old gate-leg table still survived.
In form it was the same, but the richness of
the new wood was too enticing for the cabinet-maker
not to employ. Accordingly we find examples in
mahogany.</p>

<p>In the Chippendale period <b>X</b>-shaped, cluster-leg,
gate tables are found, and turning was used in this
cluster-leg form. The ripe inventiveness of such a
design as the gate-leg table was too evident to escape
the adoption by famous makers. When ingenuity of
construction was at its zenith the gate-leg was not
likely to be discarded in fashionable furniture.</p>

<p>On p. <a href="#Page_111">109</a> two specimens of this period are
shown. The upper one is of somewhat unusual type,
having a Cupid's bow underframing. It is seen that
the Spanish foot has still survived into the eighteenth
century. The lower table is again a rare form. It is
probably early in date for mahogany, being about
1740. The Spanish foot is employed, but in a
coarsened form, unusually inelegant, and suggestive
of a golf club.</p>

<p><b>Its Utility and Beauty.</b>&mdash;It is a natural question that
one may ask as to the reason that the gate table had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
such a prolonged life. It passed through several
strong periods of fashionable styles that were overthrown
in turn by newer designs. The reason is not
far to seek. It survived because the public could
not do without it. There must have been a continuous
demand, unchecked by the excitements of
contemporary substitutes. But apparently there was
nothing to take its place, or which could permanently
supplant it. Its utility is undoubtedly one of its
most marked features. This alone affected its stability
as a possession with which the farmer's wife and
the cottager would not part. Customs long established
in the country were not easily discontinued.
Mother, daughter, and granddaughter clung to the
old and practical form of table. Nowadays there are
families in the shires whom nothing would induce to
sell their old gate tables. Partly this is for love of
the old home, but mainly is it the common-sense
attitude which rebels against the sale of any piece of
furniture which is in constant use. Many objects
long gone into disuse, but really valuable from an
artistic point of view, are readily dispensed with.
The cottager imagines that if he disposes of a mere
ornament for a sum of money with which he can buy
something useful he has effected a good "deal."</p>

<p>So much for its utility. Its beauty is a quality
which has appealed to persons of higher artistic
instincts. It is not the quaintness, because there are
scores of other objects equally quaint, nor is it altogether
the antiquity, though, of course, nowadays that
is a determining factor, but it is the actual symmetry
of form and ingenious form of construction, enhanced
<a id="Page_109"></a>
<a id="Page_110"></a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
by the wide range of decorative treatment, which
irresistibly appeal to the lover of the beautiful. These
manifold reasons, therefore, endowed the gate-leg
table with great vitality. Its hold of the people was
not relaxed till the age of the factory-made furniture.
The banalities of the early-Victorian period, which
destroyed taste in persons of finer susceptibilities than
the common folk, supplanted the old historic form,
and it was made no more.</p>

<p><b>Its Adoption in Modern Days.</b>&mdash;After William Morris
and his school had preached the revival of taste and
the return to the simple and the beautiful, and Ruskin
with flowing rhetoric had instilled a love for homespun
into men's minds, there came newer ideals
which, with gradual dissemination, have grown into
a great modern movement which has become so
overwhelmingly popular that the pendulum has
almost swung the other way. It has now become
almost a truism that the person of taste to-day sees
nothing good in anything that is not old. With
this in view, artists and persons of advanced notions,
if they could not procure the old, had copies made
for them of some of the most beautiful styles suitable
for modern requirements. In this there was always
the great Morrisian principle in view that the highest
art must show a full utilitarian purpose; so it came
about that the gate table was revived and came
gloriously into its own again. To-day, as in the
seventeenth century, there is no more popular form
of table, and the modern cabinet-maker is manufacturing
hundreds of these tables.</p>

<p>The life-history of the gate-leg table is, therefore,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
shown to be an interesting one. It is one of our
oldest forms, and its construction nowadays, save
that it is now produced in a factory, is singularly
similar to that in the days when Oliver Cromwell
was establishing our power as a voice in Europe,
when James II. had an eye towards the supremacy
of our navy, and when later our troops fought in
Flanders.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />
THE FARMHOUSE<br />
DRESSER</h2>

<p><a id="Page_114"></a></p>

<p><a id="Page_115"></a></p>

<p class="title1">CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="medium">THE FARMHOUSE DRESSER</span></p>

<p class="hanging2">The days of the late Stuarts&mdash;Its early table form with
drawers&mdash;The decorated type with shelves&mdash;William
and Mary style with double cupboards&mdash;The Queen
Anne cabriole leg&mdash;Mid-eighteenth-century types.</p>

<p>The various types of dresser associated with farmhouse
use are interesting as being apart from the
sideboard, a later fashion belonging to furniture of a
higher type. It was not until the late days of Chippendale,
and after, that the Side Table began to
be designated a Sideboard, which later became a
receptacle for wine, with a cellaret, and had a
drawer for table-linen.</p>

<p>The sideboard is not a modern term, for the word
is found in Dryden and in Milton. In the late
eighteenth-century days the sideboard had a brass
rail at the back, and was ornamented by two
mahogany urns of massive proportions. Usually
these were used for iced water and for hot water,
the latter for washing the knives and forks.</p>

<p>The Adam sideboard with its severe classical
lines, and Sheraton's elegant bow fronts and satinwood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
panels decorated with painting, belong to the
later developments of the sideboard as now known.</p>

<p>The dresser is something more homely. It is
indissolubly connected with homeliness and with the
farmhouse and the country-side. In its various forms
it has appealed to lovers of simple furniture, and
farmhouse examples have found their way into surroundings
more or less incongruous. The dresser
in its more primitive form requires the necessary
environment. It loses its charm when placed in
proximity to pieces of more pretentious character.
The cupboard dresser, or the type with open shelves,
is less decorative than some of the forms without
the back. That is to say, it requires the exactly
suitable accompaniment to prevent its simple lines
from being eclipsed by furniture of a higher grade.
The dresser is, therefore, especially desirable to the
collector furnishing a country cottage in harmonious
character; but its inclusion in the modern drawing-room
is an incongruity and its presence in the dining-room
is more often than not an unwarrantable
intrusion.</p>

<p><b>The Days of the Late Stuarts.</b>&mdash;It will be seen that
the early types have fronts finely decorated with
geometric designs panelled in the same fashion as
the Jacobean chests of drawers, such as that illustrated
p. <a href="#Page_71">69</a>. The split baluster ornament is a
noticeable feature in this style, and the fine graceful
balance of the panels with the drawers with drop
brass handles is an attractive feature beloved by
connoisseurs of the late Stuart period. The decoration
in the fronts of these early dressers is as diverse
<a id="Page_117"></a>
<a id="Page_118"></a>
<a id="Page_119"></a>
<a id="Page_120"></a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
in character as the fronts of the contemporary chests
of drawers. This variety is indicative of the personal
character imparted to the work of the old designers.
It is rare to find two examples exactly alike. They
differ in details, much in the same manner as the
brass candlesticks of the same period, which possess
the same charm of individuality.</p>

<p>EARLY OAK DRESSER. ABOUT 1660.</p>
<p>With urn-shaped legs.</p>
<p>(<i>By the courtesy of Messrs. Phillips, Hitchin.</i>)]</p>
</div></div>

<p>Of this particular type of oak Dresser the two
examples illustrated (p. <a href="#Page_121">117</a>) have characteristics
which are common to the class. The geometric front
panels, the laid-on moulding, and the Jacobean leg&mdash;in
most cases the back legs of these side dressers are
square&mdash;should be intently noticed. In regard to the
number of the legs, this is governed by the length of
the dresser. In the lower example it will be seen
that there are six legs and that the stretcher is
continued round three sides. In this example the
legs begin to show indications of the late-Jacobean
style of more delicate turning. In the upper
example the legs are bolder.</p>

<p>These are oak specimens; the walnut varieties of
similar design offer more sumptuous decoration and
belong to furniture more suitable for the manor
house than for the farm or cottage.</p>

<p>An earlier type, in date about 1660, illustrated
p. <a href="#Page_121">119</a>, exhibits a less ornate appearance and has the
split urn-shaped legs in front and flat legs at the
back. The split legs are found sometimes in gate
tables, but when such is the case it may safely be
conjectured that these tables are not of English
origin, as the split leg did not find great favour with
the English cabinet-makers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
Before passing to later examples it should be
observed that this particular form of dresser is most
frequently found without a top with shelves.
Examples there are which, as we shall show, have
the original top, but as a rule it is advisable to note
this feature in examining these Jacobean dressers, for
there are a great number in the market to which
later tops have been added, as suitable to more
modern requirements, or as likely to prove more
attractive to those collectors not familiar with the
dresser in its earlier form. Originally in early
dressers with shelves there is no back, that is to say,
the shelves showed the wall behind them. This
deficiency has been obligingly supplied by later
hands.</p>

<p>The dresser, as it found itself after certain transitional
stages had been passed through, is shown in
the early eighteenth-century piece illustrated (p. <a href="#Page_121">119</a>).
This is of the early days of the eighteenth century,
that is to say, in the reign of Queen Anne. It is
here seen that the dresser is a set piece of furniture
possessing attributes instantly marking it as having
been carefully designed with a due observance as to
the purpose to which it was to be put. The shelf at
the bottom was evidently intended for use; the
arched formation below the drawers has been
planned in that manner to admit of utensils placed
there being taken out and replaced with ease. One
can only conjecture what may have stood there,
maybe a barrel of cider, or perhaps only a breadpan.</p>

<p><b>The Decorated Type with Shelves.</b>&mdash;The back with
shelves was a useful addition, which, as will be seen
<a id="Page_123"></a>
<a id="Page_124"></a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
in the earlier examples leading up to this later
development, had borne several experiments in the
way of cupboards. In this particular specimen the
broken or serpentine outline at sides of shelves is a
noticeable feature, and always adds a grace and
charm to the dresser when employed by the cabinet-maker.
Another example in which this is effectively
used is illustrated on p. <a href="#Page_125">123</a>.</p>

</div></div>

<p>To return to the early-Jacobean types: two interesting
pieces are illustrated together (p. <a href="#Page_125">123</a>). That
on the left, with four legs and stretcher, has three
drawers, and the upper portion or back is ornamented
by a primitive scalloped design suggestive of the
country hand. The other, on the right, has six legs
and four drawers, and the upper portion is beginning
to receive detailed treatment in regard to spacing of
the shelves, and a small cupboard on each side
fills the growing need of cupboards and drawers, a
rapidly growing taste in English furniture for
domestic use as the home-life began to be more complex.
About this time nests of boxes and drawers in
lac work from the East began to be imported into
this country in the better houses, first as articles of
great luxury and beauty, on account of their colour
and fine gold work, and later as being something new
and essentially utilitarian in regard to the accommodation
they afforded for the treasures the housewife
wished to put away from the prying eyes of her
curious neighbours. As time went on, the art of the
cabinet-maker became more intricate. It is not the
place here to enter into the minutiæ of the development
of drawers and bureaus and cabinets, but the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
late eighteenth century brought such furniture, apart
from points in relation to beauty of design, to great
constructive skill. The age was one of hidden contrivances
and intricately cunning mechanism concealing
secret drawers or receptacles. Such pieces were
never made for farmhouse use; but the germ of the
idea is ever present in all furniture with indications of
locked drawers and cupboards. This is the note
of intense civilisation as against the simpler modes
of primitive folk who have no bolt to their door and
no lock to guard their possessions.</p>

<p><b>William and Mary Style with Double Cupboards.</b>&mdash;The
variety with double cupboards are interesting as
giving a date to the dressers in which they are found.
It is usually accurate to place such pieces in the
William and Mary period, that is to say from the
year 1689 to the end of the seventeenth century.
The tendency in this class of furniture is to cling
tenaciously to older forms, especially in certain
portions of the cabinet-work which presented difficulties
to the local cabinet-maker. The legs retained
their early-Jacobean character even when associated
with much later styles. This is noticeable in the
William and Mary example illustrated (p. <a href="#Page_129">127</a>). The
arcaded doors are inlaid, the canopy is decorated, the
underwork beneath the drawers belongs essentially
to the "Orange" period of design in its feeling.</p>

<p>That the dresser could be made an ornamental
piece of furniture and found its place as an important
possession in the farmhouse, bright with an array of
china, or pewter, or even silver, is amply shown by
the two examples illustrated together of which the
<a id="Page_127"></a>
<a id="Page_128"></a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
foregoing is one. The other oak dresser has at the
top, where the mugs are hanging, the original mug-hooks.
It is of the square-leg type and the arcaded
work below the drawers gives distinction to its lines;
it possesses also the broken or serpentine ends to
the shelves. These curves and simple touches of
ornament all contribute to make such dressers
pleasing in character and representative of native
work attempting with strong endeavour to produce
artistic results suitable to their environment.</p>

<p><b>The Queen Anne Cabriole Leg.</b>&mdash;It is not to be
expected that the long-continued triumph of the
cabriole leg of the eighteenth century would leave
the dresser without making its mark thereon. The
exact curve of the cabriole leg is dangerous in the
hands of a novice, who rarely if ever gets the correct
balance in conjunction with the rest of the construction.
Accordingly, in farmhouse pieces this tells its
own story. It is as though the cabriole leg were a
sudden afterthought. This touch of representative
want of repose is shown in the specimen illustrated
(p. <a href="#Page_137">135</a>). In date this is about 1740, and is a somewhat
rare form, having double cupboards.</p>

<p>A unique Dresser and Clock combined is illustrated
(p. <a href="#Page_133">131</a>). The form of the dresser, it will be seen,
is quite different from other specimens. The back
is only sufficiently high to carry a row of small
drawers. The legs are circular and tapered, terminating
in circular feet. In the centre of the dresser
is a clock of the familiar grandfather form in
miniature. This clock is not an addition to the
dresser, but is a portion of the dresser and was made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
with it. The illustration shows the size of the door
of the clock-case, with its hinges not cut down or in
any way interfered with, and the lock on the other
side is in the centre of the panel. It is obvious that
no later hand has tampered with this fine example,
and it stands as a remarkable dresser and unique in
form in its construction with this clock.</p>

<p><b>Mid-eighteenth-century Types.</b>&mdash;In the Lancashire
Dresser illustrated (p. <a href="#Page_137">135</a>) the top is reminiscent of
early types. The cupboard has removed its position
to the middle, a departure from all earlier forms.
This is a very characteristic example, and the ample
drawer accommodation shows the speedy transition
from the old form of dresser through its varied stages
to the later modern variety of the kitchen dresser,
devoid of poetry and lacking interest to the collector,
and yet to the student having traces of its ancient
lineage.</p>

<p>The eighteenth-century farmhouse varieties offer
no great departure. They aim at being capacious
and massive. They make no pretensions to approach
the niceties of the sideboard in use in the better
houses. They supply an undoubted want in the
farmhouse for storage. There were cordials and
home-made wines and much prized linen and a
bright array of silver and Sheffield plate and pewter,
and no doubt tea services or porcelain from the new
English factories of Worcester, Derby, Bow, or
maybe Plymouth or Bristol, to be shielded from
breakage. The farmer's wife and the farmer's
daughters were less than human if they did not
follow the new fashions in some degree, more or
<a id="Page_131"></a>
<a id="Page_132"></a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
less, in tea-drinking and in becoming the proud
possessors of tea services and dinner services somewhat
more delicate than the old delft and coarse
Staffordshire ware. The cupboards had ample
accommodation for these more valuable accessories
of the farmhouse parlour. The cabinet-maker therefore
developed on lines exactly suitable for the
country clients whom he served.</p>

<p>UNIQUE DRESSER AND CLOCK COMBINED.</p>
<p>The clock is not an addition, but is a portion of the dresser, and was made for it.</p>
<p>(<i>In the collection of D. A. Bevan, Esq.</i>)</p>
</div></div>

<p>The late forms show this marked tendency to
provide innumerable drawers and cupboards, in the
farmhouse dressers contemporary with Chippendale.
Many examples are found which are practically
elongated chests of drawers; the old characteristics
of the dresser are absent, the back has disappeared
altogether. There is no top with shelves. Eight large
drawers and two capacious cupboards give great
storage room in a piece often 9 feet in length. There
is nothing finicking in this type of furniture. It stands
for homely comfort and love of domestic order. We
may be sure that the good dame who used this lower
piece, with its eight solid drawers with sound locks,
was a person of frugal habits and love of the old
farmstead. We may safely assume that she had a
well-filled stocking hidden away somewhere in this
old-fashioned repository, put by for the rainy day.</p>

<p>In conclusion it may be said that a good deal has
been talked about Welsh dressers, as though they
were a type absolutely apart from any other. The
differences are not great, as the carving, in which the
Welsh craftsman offers characteristics of his own, is
absent in pieces of furniture such as the dresser.
Then there is the Normandy dresser, a much-abused
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
term: a considerable number of these, and others,
too, from Brittany, have been imported and the
terms have become trade descriptions. But in the
main the English dresser has passed through the
phases we have described, and the outlines herein
suggested may be filled in by the painstaking
collector. In the chapter dealing with local types
there is an illustration of a Lancashire dresser (p. <a href="#Page_273">273</a>)
which adds one more example to the gallery of
dressers we give as types in this chapter.

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />

<p><a id="Page_138"></a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span></p>

<p class="title1">CHAPTER V</p>

<p class="hanging2">THE BIBLE-BOX, THE CRADLE, THE SPINNING-WHEEL,<br />
AND THE BACON-CUPBOARD</p>

<p class="hanging2">The Puritan days of the seventeenth century&mdash;The
Protestant Bible in every home&mdash;The variety of
carving found in Bible-boxes&mdash;The Jacobean cradle
and its forms&mdash;The spinning-wheel&mdash;The bacon-cupboard.</p>

<p>The Authorised version of the Holy Bible, "translated
out of the original tongues and with the former
translations diligently compared and revised," by
His Majesty's command, found a place in every
household in Stuart days. The letter of the learned
translators "To the most High and Mighty Prince
James, by the Grace of God, King of Great Britain,
France, and Ireland, Defender of the Faith," &amp;c.,
retains its place in modern editions. It is an historic
document worthy of preservation, and perhaps those
who have forgotten its terms may be glad to have
their memory refreshed. It is of surpassing moment
to all who recognise the Protestant derivation of the
Bible as we now know it, and the sectarian feelings
which inspired the translators under King James in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
their fulsome dedication to the Modern Solomon.
"Great and manifold were the blessings, most dread
Sovereign, which Almighty God the Father of all
mercies bestowed upon us the people of England,
when first he sent your Majesty's Royal Person to
rule and reign over us. For whereas it was the
expectation of many, who wished not well unto
our <i>Sion</i>, that upon the setting of that bright
Occidental Star, Queen Elizabeth, of most happy
memory, some thick and palpable clouds of darkness
would so have overshadowed this land, that men
should have been in doubt which way they were to
walk; and that it should hardly be known who was
to direct the unsettled State; the appearance of your
Majesty, as the Sun in its strength, instantly dispelled
those supposed and surmised mists, and gave unto all
that were well affected exceeding cause of comfort;
especially when we beheld the Government established
in Your Highness and your hopeful seed, by
an undoubted title, and this also accompanied by
peace and tranquillity at home and abroad."</p>

<p>It is, as we affirm, an interesting document as
showing the Puritan tendencies at a time when much
was in the melting-pot and the first of the Stuarts,
with his broad Scots accent and his ungainly ways,
came down to St. James's from the North. Compare
the above literary dedication to James the First with
the word-portrait painted by Green the historian, and
one may draw one's own inferences. "His big head,
his slobbering tongue, his quilted clothes, his rickety
legs, stood out in as grotesque a contrast with all that
men recalled of Henry or of Elizabeth as his gabble
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
and rodomontade, his want of personal dignity, his
buffoonery, his coarseness of speech, his pedantry,
his contemptible cowardice. Under this ridiculous
exterior, however, lay a man of much natural ability,
a ripe scholar with a considerable fund of shrewdness,
of mother-wit, and ready repartee."</p>

<p><b>The Protestant Bible in every Home.</b>&mdash;Himself a
theologian, James influenced his contemporaries.
"Theology rules there," said Grotius of England
only two years after Elizabeth's death. There was
an indifference to pure letters and persons were
counted fine scholars who were diligent in the study
of the Bible. The language of the people became
enriched with this study, which extended to all
classes. John Bunyan, the son of a tinker at Elstow,
learned his intense prose from the Bible. The peasant
absorbed the Bible till its words became his own.
With the Puritan movement came the production
of men of serious type, and with it too came the
disappearance of the richer and brighter life and
humour of Elizabethan days. It was a literary
movement and a religious movement which penetrated
to the lower classes and often left the upper
classes and gentry unmoved. In dealing with this
and its reflex upon the domestic habits of the people,
the visible effects in regard to furniture are strikingly
evident in the plethora of Bible-boxes belonging to
those in this period of Biblical study, to whom
Shakespeare and Ben Jonson were unknown and
Spenser's <em>Faerie Queene</em> and Milton's <em>Comus</em> were
sealed books.</p>

<p>It would almost seem that in many cases the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
Bible was the only book which was read and
treasured. It was incorporated in the home life. It
served as a register to record the names and dates
of birth and death or marriage of members of
the family. Some of these family registers have
been most valuable in tracing details in biography
where parish registers have failed to supply the
necessary information.</p>

<p><b>The Variety of Carving found in Bible-boxes.</b>&mdash;We
give a series of illustrations indicating some of the
interesting details of carving to be found on such
boxes, where, as in work intended for a treasure-chest
to preserve a sacred book, considerable zeal
has gone to the elaboration of ornament. These
seventeenth-century relics of a wave of religious
enthusiasm are the crude Puritan likenesses, belonging
to a less innately artistic race, of the tabernacles
and ivory carved Madonnas and saints of the Italian
renaissance. They both, though poles asunder in
realisation, represent the instinctive love of man for
ornament in connection with his religious emotions.
Savage races with another ritual produce religious
and ceremonial woodcarving representative of their
best. Here, then, is the Puritan craftsmanship, mainly
of provincial origin and found scattered over various
parts of the country, following <i>motifs</i> executed by
the same hands as Jacobean chairs and dressers, but
bearing rich touches of ornament, betraying much
originality, within the limited scope of Jacobean design.</p>

<p>The carving has nothing of the humour or strong
bold relief of the miserere seats of the palmy days of
the woodcarver in the fifteenth and early sixteenth
<a id="Page_143"></a>
<a id="Page_144"></a>
<a id="Page_145"></a>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
century in details that might well have been applied
to the Bible-box. The ambition of the Puritan woodcarver
never reached figure-work, or he might have
represented Biblical scenes if his abhorrence of graven
images had not demoralised his fancy. Some of the
early boxes have bold carving. We illustrate a fine
example (p. <a href="#Page_147">143</a>) of the time of James I., about 1600.
The design is floral, which embodies the well-known
conventional rose. Illustrated on the same page is
another carved box of unusual pattern with floriated
design. It was a frequent practice to treat the front
of the box as though it were continuous and the
pattern leaves off at the ends much in the same
manner as modern wallpaper. In the box above it
will be seen that the front is panelled and the design
is confined to the circumscribed area.</p>

<p>Another piece with very rare pattern, in date
about 1650, has a bold type of carving in the two
semicircles stretched across the front. This use of
semicircles occurs in types usually found. The
example illustrated (p. <a href="#Page_147">145</a>) has incised carving or
"scratch." It will be seen that there is never an
attempt at inlay or any of the delicacies of the
refined craftsman. Among the various types of
"scratch" boxes the use of circles and heart-shaped
ornament is constant. The locks found on this
type of box are always of the class as shown in the
illustration, and the clasp is well known.</p>

<p>In the collection of Bible-boxes the novice must
carefully learn the exact limitations of the school of
woodworkers in this minor field. The touch of the
foreign craftsman should be easily recognisable, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
its piquancy and real artistic feeling. These Puritan
Bible-boxes have flat lids, and in order to give some
touch of romance to them or whet the appetite of
the collector they are frequently described as "lace-boxes,"
though it is very doubtful if such boxes were
ever used for storing lace. Sometimes similar boxes
with sloping lids were used as early forms of writing-desks.</p>

<p><b>The Jacobean Cradle.</b>&mdash;The specimens of this type
of furniture always exhibit, in the oak variety
associated with farmhouse use, a plainness as a noticeable
factor. They are usually panelled, but the
panel has received no carved ornament and is
especially simple. Of course they always have
rockers. In the examples illustrated the slight
variation in these rockers will be observed. Sometimes
they are plain and sometimes they have slight
ornamental curves. The only other ornament may
be found in the turned knobs at the foot and sometimes
at the head. Sometimes there are fine knobs
on the hood.</p>

<p>The hood is sometimes shaped and exhibits a
naïve attempt at symmetrical design. These cradles
have long been familiar objects in cottagers' homes,
but are now being displaced by modern wicker
cradles. The picture <i>A Flood</i> (1870), by Sir John
E. Millais, shows one of these cradles floating in a
flooded meadow. The baby is crowing with delight,
and a black cat sits at the foot of the cradle.</p>

<p>The holes in the example illustrated (p. <a href="#Page_153">149</a>) are
intended to receive a cord stretched across the cradle
to protect the occupant.<a id="Page_149"></a><a id="Page_150"></a>

</div></div>

<p><b>The Spinning-wheel.</b>&mdash;To this day the spinning-wheel
is used in Scotland, in the Highlands. The
wool or yarn winders are usually in windlass form
with six spokes. The turning upon these winders
and spinning wheels resembles the spindles on the
spindle-back chairs. There is in Buckinghamshire
bobbins a similar turning, individual in character and
exhibiting considerable artistic beauty. In spinning-wheels
there is considerable scope for the use of fine
touches of ornament, in such practical objects dear
to the housewife. Bone sometimes was used in
the turned knobs. The making of these spinning-wheels
was undertaken by persons desirous of
winning the esteem of those who used them. Many
of them have come down as heirlooms in families
and have not been held as objects of art, to be
regarded as curiosities, but as articles of everyday
use.</p>

<p>The use of the spinning-wheel was not confined
exclusively to the farmer's wife. In early days great
ladies were adepts at spinning. By the time of
George III. it was employed by the ladies of titled
families. Mrs. Delany, when staying with the
Duchess of Portland at Bulstrode, writes: "The
Queen came about twelve o'clock, and caught me at
my spinning-wheel, and made me spin on and give
her a lesson afterwards; and I must say she did it
tolerably for a queen." This letter, dated 1781, goes
to prove two things, that spinning was a real task
still undertaken by great ladies, and not a fashionable
amusement. Had it been the latter Mrs.
Delany would not have used the expression "caught
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
me at my spinning-wheel," wherein she indicates that
the occupation was somewhat of a menial one.</p>

<p>In regard to the Buckinghamshire bobbins, sometimes
finely carved in bone, those illustrated (p 151.)
indicate the character of the cottagers' treasures in
the pillow-lace-making districts. The patterns of
these bobbins are not repeated. Individual touches
are given to these bobbins by the village turners
which are not duplicated. In use, the bobbin has to
be identified by some mark, and beads of different
colours are employed, which are affixed by means of
a wire to the bobbin, as is shown in the illustration.</p>

<p><b>The Bacon-cupboard.</b>&mdash;Another class which it is
convenient to place among miscellaneous objects is
the bacon-cupboard. The illustration (p. <a href="#Page_230">231</a>) shows
the type of bacon-cupboard with seat and arms and
drawers beneath. The position held by the bacon-cupboard
in the farmhouse is shown by the growing
dignity in the character of these cupboards. The
gradual growth and development are shown in many
specimens of the Queen Anne period, frequently of
Lancashire origin. Such pieces, with classic pilasters,
broken cornice, and bevelled panels and drawers
beneath, are typified in wardrobes and dressers belonging
to eighteenth-century farmhouse furniture.
The development of capacious cupboards for various
domestic uses is noticeable in this class of furniture
up to early nineteenth-century days.</p>

<p class="title1">CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="medium">EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STYLES</span></p>

<p class="hanging2">The advent of the cabriole leg&mdash;The so-called Queen
Anne style&mdash;The survival of oak in the provinces&mdash;The
influence of walnut on cabinet-making&mdash;The
early-Georgian types&mdash;Chippendale and his
contemporaries.</p>

<p>The dawn of the eighteenth century practically
commenced with the reign of Queen Anne. The
times were troublous. As princess, in the days of
William the Dutchman and her sister Mary, she
was forbidden the Court as John Churchill, then
Earl of Marlborough, designed to overthrow William
and place Anne on the throne. "Were I and my
Lord Marlborough private persons," William exclaimed,
"the sword would have to settle between us."</p>

<p>At the death of Mary the Princess Anne, together
with the Marlboroughs, was recalled to St. James's.
At the death of William, in 1702, Anne came to the
throne. Only just in her thirty-seventh year, she
was so corpulent and gouty that she could not walk
from Westminster Hall to the Abbey, and was
carried in an open chair. During the Coronation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
ceremony she was too infirm to support herself in a
standing position without assistance.</p>

<p>The age of Anne is remarkable for its restless
intrigues. Court plots were rife when Queen Anne
"Mrs. Morley" in her private letters to the Duchess
of Marlborough, who was "Mrs. Freeman," finally
broke with the overbearing Duchess and made
Abigail Hill, one of the Marlborough creatures, her
chief confidant. The Protestant Whig party favoured
the long war in the Low Countries and in Spain,
although conducted by a Tory general, Marlborough,
who, by the way, did not take the field in Flanders
till he was fifty-two, a remarkable achievement for so
great a military career, wherein he never fought a
battle in which he was not victorious.</p>

<p>The greatness of Marlborough is indisputable.
His fond love for his wife runs like a gold thread
through the dark web of his life. His wife had,
during a large part of Anne's reign, despotic empire
over Anne's feeble mind. "History exhibits to us
few spectacles more remarkable," says Lord
Macaulay, "than that of a great and wise man who,
when he had contrived vast and profound schemes of
policy, could carry them into effect only by inducing
one foolish woman, who was often unmanageable, to
manage another woman who was more foolish still."</p>

<p>To us now, with the secret springs of history laid
bare, there is much to marvel at, much to deplore as
trivial. In regard to matters of high state and the
suppleness of time-servers, memoirs and private
journals have exposed many a skeleton carefully
hidden from public gaze. But of the life of the
<a id="Page_159"></a>
<a id="Page_160"></a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
people, especially the life in the country districts,
the picture is somewhat blurred. Men of letters
flocked to the town&mdash;the town was London. Provincial
life lies behind a curtain. There were Spanish
doubloons coming up from Bristol and prize-money
from the wars was scattered inland from the ports.
Scotland was united to England by the Act of
Union. "I desire," said the Queen, "and expect
from my subjects of both nations that from henceforth
they act with all possible respect and kindness
to one another, and so that it may appear to all the
world they have hearts disposed to become one
people." This wish has been amply fulfilled and the
union has become something more than a name.
Never have two peoples different in thought, in
tradition, and in established law become so completely
welded together.</p>

<p>But the war of the Spanish Succession must have
drained English blood as it taxed English pockets.
"Six millions of supplies and almost fifty millions
of debt," wrote Swift bitterly. The tide of Marlborough's
success was undoubtedly secured by the
outpouring of English lives. Stalwart levies of men
from the shires went to join the strange medley of
the forces of the Allies commanded by Marlborough.
Dutchmen, Danes, Hanoverians, Würtembergers, and
Austrians jostled shoulders with each other in his
troops. He launched them with calm imperturbability
against his opponents at Malplaquet, for example,
where with a Pyrrhic triumph he lost twenty-four
thousand men against half that number of the French
behind their entrenchments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
It is little wonder that the war was unpopular in
the country, where the Spanish Succession and the
"balance of power" were only symbols for so much
pressure on the needs of the labouring classes. Bonfires
might be lit for Blenheim, but many a village
mourned those who would never return.</p>

<p>In spite of this intermingling of England with
European politics, the general life of the people
remained untouched from outside influence in regard
to arts and manufacture. Cut off from intercourse
with France, the grandeur of the art of Louis
Quatorze was as far removed from early eighteenth-century
England as though Boulle and Jean Bérain
and Lepaute were in another continent and the
château of Versailles in the fastnesses of the Urals.
It is true that Louis XIV. presented two wonderful
cabinets to the Duke of Monmouth, exquisite
examples of metal inlay and coloured marquetry,
but such pieces were beyond the capabilities of any
English craftsman to emulate.</p>

<p>The chief innovations of the early eighteenth
century followed the Dutch lines familiarised in the
preceding days of William and Mary. Oak remained
in farmhouse and country furniture, but in the fashionable
world walnut was extensively used, and occasionally
mahogany. Corner cupboards were introduced
early in the reign of Anne, and hooped chairs,
familiar in engravings of Flemish interiors, came
into general use. Fiddle-splat chairs were also
common in the first half of the eighteenth century.
In regard to feet, the ball-and-claw, and club foot
were introduced. Caning of chairs went out of

<a id="Page_165"></a>
<a id="Page_166"></a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
fashion till the end of the century. Shell and
pendant ornament on knees of chair-legs became
marked features, and, above all, the cabriole leg to
chairs and tables is associated with the early years
of the reign, and the term "Queen Anne" is always
applied to such pieces.</p>

<p><b>The Cabriole Leg.</b>&mdash;This form of leg, swelling into
massive proportions where it joins the seat, and curving
outwards and tapering to a ball-and-claw foot
or a club foot, lasted till end of Chippendale period,
roughly, for nearly half a century. It assumed
various forms until it was supplanted by the straight
leg, and the stretcher, which had disappeared with
the use of the cabriole leg, again came into use.</p>

<p>Examples of the cabriole leg appear as illustrations
to various types of furniture in this chapter.
At first its use did not interfere with the employment
of the stretcher, but about 1710 the stretcher disappeared.
The Lancashire Queen Anne settle illustrated
(p. <a href="#Page_161">159</a>) shows the stretcher joining the front
leg to the back. In the settle illustrated above,
in date 1760, it will be seen the stretchers have
vanished.</p>

<p><b>The So-called Queen Anne Style.</b>&mdash;Fashions slowly
adopted in cabinet design do not readily arrange
themselves in exact periods coinciding with the
reigns of individual sovereigns. But it is convenient
to affix a label to certain marked changes and attribute
their general use to a particular reign. The
innovation of the square panel with broken corners
and ornamental curves at top is found in Queen
Anne settles. The departure from the square
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
panel and line of the curved and broken top is
exhibited in the second Great Seal of Anne,
commemorating the Union with Scotland. It is
reminiscent of the Dutch influence, and is found
in Sussex firebacks of an earlier period. The
straight lines of early-Jacobean cabinet-work were
rapidly undergoing a change; the square wooden
back of the chair was shortly to be replaced by
fiddle splats, which in their turn, in late-Georgian
days, became pierced and fretted and carved under
the genius of Chippendale's hand.</p>

<p>The two settles illustrated (p. <a href="#Page_161">159</a>) show several
interesting points. The panels are typical of the
love of the curved line, which Hogarth defined as the
line of beauty. In the upper one the arms still
retain the old Jacobean form in this farmhouse
example. The ball foot still clings to the earlier
form. The seat is sunk to receive a long cushion.
In the adjacent specimen the seat with its cushion
and the curved <b>S</b> arms upholstered show the transition
into the later type of modern settee.</p>

<p>The curved outline finds similar expression in the
hood of grandfather clock-cases and in the shape
of metal dials. A cupboard with drawers illustrated
(p. <a href="#Page_167">163</a>) has what is known as a "swan head." The
panels to the doors have similarly novel features in
their structure. It will be observed that there is a
square pedestal at the top of this piece, which was
intended as a stand for a delft or Chinese jar. The
drawers of this cupboard have round beadings.</p>

<p>The typical instance of curved design with not
a single straight line, not even the back legs, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
are bowed, is the grandfather chair with the high
back, upholstered all over. The cabriole legs with
ball-and claw-feet, the <b>C</b>-shaped arms, the scroll
upholstered wings, and the oval back, depart from
the rectilinear; even the underframing of the seat
is bow-shaped. Similarly, the walnut arm-chairs of
the period from 1690 to 1715 had bold curves. The
arms always possessed a curious scroll, the backs had
broad splats with curling shoulders, and often a
broad bold ribbon pattern making two loops to fill
up the top of the hoop at the back, with a carved
shell at the point of intersection. Big pieces of
furniture, such as bureaus, had the broken arch pediment,
and smaller objects, such as mirrors, had the
arched or broken top; and when these dressing
mirrors had small drawers, these disdained the
straight front and became convex.</p>

<p>Under the Dutch influence, in the first period of
English veneer work, from about 1675 to 1715, very
fine cabinets and bureaus and chests of drawers were
made. Walnut was the wood employed, with the
panels inlaid with pollard elm, boxwood, ebony,
mahogany, sycamore, and other coloured woods.
Figured walnut was beloved by the cabinet-maker
beginning to feel his way in colour schemes of
decoration. Bandings of herring-bone inlay and
rounded mouldings to drawers are very characteristic.
Bureaus and important pieces had birds and
flowers and trees or feather marquetry after fine
Dutch models. Picked walnut, especially exhibiting
a fine feathered figure, was used as veneer, and with
these and other glorious creations of the walnut
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
school of cabinet-workers the age of walnut may be
said to have been in full swing.</p>

<p><b>The Survival of Oak in the Provinces.</b>&mdash;The foregoing
descriptions apply to fashionable folks' furniture.
Such fashions did not come into usage in the farmhouses
and in the cottages. Oak was still employed
without being displaced by the walnut of the town
maker. Oak was in the main more suitable for the
particular class of furniture which was likely to
receive less delicate care than the writing-cabinets
and bureaus and the china-cupboards of more fastidious
people. Tea-drinking had become the luxury
of the great world of society, and had hardly come
into general use in the country till late in the reign
of Anne, though by 1690 it had gained considerable
favour in London. Coffee was introduced
slightly earlier, and many invectives in broadsides
and in poetical satires appear in the late seventeenth
century against coffee and coffee-houses. In 1674
the "Women's Petition against Coffee" complained
that "it made men as unfruitful as the deserts
whence that unhappy berry is said to be brought;
that the offspring of our mighty ancestors would
dwindle into a succession of apes and pigmies, and
on a domestic message a husband would stop by the
way to drink a couple of cups of coffee." The
prejudice against coffee, and especially against coffee-houses,
was lasting, and coffee failed to establish
itself as a national beverage. The labouring classes
declined to be weaned from their ale and other
stronger drinks. The Spaniards brought chocolate
from Mexico; Roger North, Attorney-General to
<a id="Page_171"></a>

<a id="Page_173"></a>
<a id="Page_174"></a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
James II., uttered a violent polemic against chocolate
houses, perhaps more on account of the political
clubs gathered there than against the beverage itself.
"The use of coffee-houses," says he, "seems much
improved by a new invention called chocolate-houses,
for the benefit of rooks and cullies of quality, where
gaming is added to the rest, as if the Devil had
erected a new university, and those were the colleges
of its professors."</p>

<p>The varying phases of town life, of which the
above quotations give a passing glimpse, found little
reflex in the sturdy unchanging life of the provinces.
Generation after generation, men farmed the same
lands and their dependents lived in cottages adjacent;
tillers of the ground, herdsmen, toilers in the fields,
living by the sweat of their brow. They were content
with simpler pleasures, which centred round the alehouse
and the village green, or maybe the village
church, if the hunting rector and the studious vicar
were not too heedless of the fate of their flock. But
other influences were soon to be at work to break
the lethargy of those of the clergy who slumbered.
Wesley founded the Methodist movement. Whitefield
began his sermons in the fields and looked down
from a green slope on several thousand colliers grimy
from the coalpits near Bristol to see, as he preached,
tears "making white channels down their blackened
cheeks." Later again, Hannah More drew sympathy
to the poverty and crime of the agricultural classes.</p>

<p><b>The Influence of Walnut on Cabinet-making.</b>&mdash;If oak
was the wood which the country joiner loved best, he
was not without some sympathetic leaning towards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
the effects which could be produced in the softer
walnut. Such styles accordingly began slowly to
have a marked influence upon the farmhouse furniture
in early-Georgian days. It was not easy to produce
curved lines in the refractory oak, tough and brittle,
but the village craftsman essayed his best to please
his patrons whose taste had been caught by the
newer fashions observed in the squire's parlour when
paying rare visits.</p>

<p>In the two examples illustrated of farmhouse
cupboard and bureau bookcase (p. <a href="#Page_167">163</a>) it will be
seen that here is the country maker definitely trying
his skill in his native wood to emulate the finer
walnut examples of town cabinet-makers. This is
even more noticeable in regard to some of the tables
actually found in farmhouses belonging to as early as
the first quarter of the eighteenth century. The two
specimens illustrated (p. <a href="#Page_167">165</a>) exemplify this tendency
to imitate the designs of trained workers.
The country touch always betrays itself in the
cabriole leg, whether in chair or in table. The upper
table has less <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naïveté</i> than most examples found.
There is a balance in its construction rarely found in
provincial work. The legs, always the stumbling-block
to the less experienced artificer, are here of
exceptionally fine proportions, terminating in club
feet. The lower table shows a less capable treatment
of the cabriole leg. The hoof foot and the carved
knee have obviously been copied from a fine Queen
Anne model. In the underframing of both tables
there is an experiment in ornament and form rarely
attempted except in the highest flights of the country
<a id="Page_177"></a>
<a id="Page_178"></a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
maker, and as such these two fine examples must be
regarded.</p>

<p><b>The Early Georgian Types.</b>&mdash;Treating of the early-Hanoverian
period from the death of Queen Anne
in 1714, and including the reigns of George I. from
1714 to 1727 and George II. from 1727 to 1760,
furniture of all types begins to assume a complexity of
construction. At the final outburst the fine masterpieces
of creation of the great schools of design
during the last half of the eighteenth century, embodied
the life-work of Chippendale, the brothers
Adam, Hepplewhite, Sheraton, and many others.
This period from 1750 to 1800 was the golden age
of design in England. It has had a far-reaching
effect, and still casts its glory upon the present-day
schools of designers, whose adaptations and lines of
progress are based upon the finest flower of the
eighteenth-century styles.</p>

<p>The massive walnut chairs with deep underframing
and broad hoop backs departed from the solid splats
of the Anne style and endeavoured to become less
squat by the employment of banded ribbon-work,
coarse, heavy, and ponderous in style. Settees, arm-chairs
and single chairs in this style came as the final
efforts of the walnut school. The graceful ribbon
designs interlacing each other in knots, and the
flowing carving in mahogany of Chippendale, put a
period to all dullness and heavy design. With the
new style and the new wood a splendid field was
opened to cabinet-makers, and the quick appreciation
of these opportunities signalised their work as of
permanent artistic value.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
Among more important pieces, though still falling
under the category of farmhouse styles, may be
mentioned the Queen Anne glass or china cupboard,
and the Georgian corner cupboard, illustrated p. <a href="#Page_175">171</a>.</p>

<p>The former has heavy bars, which mark the early
type prior to tracery, and it has spun-glass doors.
Porcelain factories at Bow, Worcester, and Derby
brought such cupboards into more general use after
the middle of the century. Staffordshire earthenware
tea and coffee services were found in great
numbers in farmhouses and cottages. After the
days of delft and stoneware came the prized china
services of the housewife. Pewter was largely used,
but the number of ale-jugs of Toby form, or cider-mugs
with rural subjects to suit the tastes of the
users, indicate that more modern ideas and taste, once
exclusive to the world of fashion, had penetrated the
country districts.</p>

<p>The Georgian corner cupboard shows the broken
architraves and cushion top. The hinges should be
noticed as being original.</p>

<p><b>Chippendale and his Contemporaries.</b>&mdash;At first using
the cabriole leg with ball-and-claw foot, not quite
as he found it, but reduced to slightly more slender
proportions to be in symmetry with his less massive
backs to chairs, Chippendale came to the straight
line. He employed it in the legs of tables and in
the seats of chairs, in the bracket supports, and in
the top rail of his chairs. Chippendale in his day, made
the first straight top rail to the chair. It is interesting
to note the phases of changing design in country-made
furniture prior to his time, and the sudden

<a id="Page_183"></a>
<a id="Page_184"></a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
mastery of form which became the common inheritance
of all after his and other contemporary design-books
were promulgated broadcast.</p>

</div></div>

<p>In the table the cabriole leg showed early signs of
passing away. The two examples illustrated (p. <a href="#Page_175">173</a>)
clearly indicate this. The upper one, of the time of
Queen Anne, shows the cabriole leg in fine proportion
under due subjection, and is a delicate example of
fine cabinet-work. The lower one sees the leg losing
its cabriole curve, but still rounded and still possessing
the club foot.</p>

<p>Even more interesting are the two tables illustrated
(p. <a href="#Page_179">177</a>). The country maker was slow to adopt the
cabriole leg when it was fashionable, but when it
became unfashionable he was equally loth to depart
from his accustomed style. These clearly point to the
transition between the cabriole leg and the straight
leg of Chippendale, and are about 1760 in date.</p>

<p>The forms of design of tables of eighteenth-century
date are extremely varied in character, denoting the
rapidly changing habits of the people. The Queen
Anne tea-table, with scalloped edges for cups, marks
the note of preciosity creeping into country life. A
revolving bookstand in table form, of about 1720 in
date, is another rare piece. The adjacent table
(p. <a href="#Page_185">181</a>) is country Chippendale. The exaggerated
knee and the feeble ball-and-claw foot mark the
failure of the provincial hand at curved work, accurate
though he might be in straight joinery. The "Cupid's
bow" underframing is interesting in combination with
the rest of the design.</p>

<p>The tripod table offered difficulties of construction
and is not often found. The example illustrated is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
probably unique in form. In date it is about 1760,
and is remarkable for the attempt at elaborate rococo
work. Sometimes, though not often, mahogany was
used in farmhouse examples. The table illustrated
(p. <a href="#Page_185">183</a>) is an instance of the use of this wood instead
of oak. It is about 1730 in date, and exhibits an
unusual form in the round cross stretcher, a touch of
originality by the maker. It is, as will be seen, a
square-topped table with flaps.</p>

<p>Elaboration of a high order was happily not often
attempted by the country workman, or the results
with his limited experience would have been disastrous.
Instead of a fine series of really good, solid,
and well-constructed furniture made for practical use
we should have had a wilderness of failures at
attempting the impossible. A copy of a fine
Chippendale side-table illustrated (p. <a href="#Page_187">187</a>) is a case
in point. There is the usual want of balance in
the poise of the leg, but the carving is of exceptional
character. The table beneath, with its long
and tapering legs, has all the characteristics of the
Adam style. The beaded decoration on the legs,
the classic fluting and the carved rosette claim
distant relationship with the classic inventions of
Robert Adam. The wood is pinewood, and as an
example it is of singular interest.</p>

<p>The rapid survey of eighteenth-century influences
bearing on the class of furniture of which this volume
treats will perhaps induce the collector to scrutinise
more carefully all pieces coming under his notice,
with a view to arriving at their salient features in
connection with the native design of more or less
untutored craftsmen.</p>

<p class="title1">CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="medium">THE EVOLUTION OF THE CHAIR</span></p>

<p class="hanging2">Early days&mdash;The typical Jacobean oak chair&mdash;The
evolution of the stretcher&mdash;The chair-back and its
development&mdash;Transition between Jacobean and
William and Mary forms&mdash;Farmhouse styles contemporary
with the cane-back chair&mdash;The Queen
Anne splat&mdash;Country Chippendale, Hepplewhite,
and Sheraton&mdash;The grandfather chair&mdash;Ladder-back
types&mdash;The spindle-back chair&mdash;Corner chairs.</p>

<p>In order to deal exhaustively with the evolution of
the chair from its earliest forms to the latest developments
in sumptuous upholstery, it would be necessary
to make an extended survey of furniture, dating back
to early classic days. To enumerate the manifold
varieties belonging to various countries and to trace
the gradual progress in form, which kept pace with
the advance in civilisation, would be of sufficient
interest to occupy a whole volume. Man, as a sitting
or lounging animal, has grown to require more
elaborate forms of chair, or settee, or sofa, and the
modern tendency has been towards comfort and
luxury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
In regard to English furniture the intense contrast
between the days of Elizabeth and those of Victoria
is at once noticeable. According to Lord Macaulay
in his comparison between the manners of his day
and those of the past, the furniture of a middle-class
dwelling-house of the nineteenth century was equal
to that of a rich merchant in the time of Elizabeth.
In general this may be true, though not as regards
the spacious structure and the massive grandeur of
the Tudor house. In many details the differences
are most noteworthy. The wide gulf dividing the
modern world from the days of the Armada may be
realised by reflecting on such an astounding fact that
Queen Elizabeth possessed at one time the only pair
of silk stockings in her realm, which were presented
to her by Mistress Montague, "which pleased her so
well that she would never wear any cloth hose
afterwards."</p>

<p>The sturdy character of the yeomen of the days
of the Tudors is exhibited in their furniture. The
illustrations of this chapter in regard to the chair
and its structural development indicate the slowly
acquired tastes, running some decades behind the
fashionable furniture, strong with foreign influences,
which had come into more or less general use.
"England no longer sent her fleeces to be woven in
Flanders and to be dyed in Florence. The spinning
of yarn, the weaving, fulling, and dyeing of cloth, was
spreading rapidly from the towns to the country-side.
The worsted trade, of which Norwich was the centre,
extended over the whole of the Eastern Counties.
Farmers' wives everywhere began to spin their wool
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
from their own sheep's backs into a coarse homespun."</p>

<p>The rough and wattled farmhouses were being
replaced by dwellings of brick and stone. The disuse
of salt fish and the greater consumption of meat
marked the improvement which was taking place
among the countryfolk. The wooden trenchers in
the farmhouses were supplanted by pewter, and there
were yeomen who could boast of their silver. Carpets
in richer dwelling-houses superseded the wretched
flooring of rushes. Even pillows, now in common
usage, were articles of luxury in the sixteenth
century. The farmer and the trader deemed them
as only fit "for women in child-bed." The chimney-corner
came into usage in Elizabethan days with the
general use of chimneys. The mediæval fortress had
given place to the grandeur of the Elizabethan hall
in the houses of the wealthy merchants. The rise of
the middle classes brought with it in its wake the
corresponding advance of the yeomen and their
dependents. Visions of the New World "threw a
haze of prodigality and profusion over the imagination
of the meanest seaman."</p>

<p><b>Early Days.</b>&mdash;Of farmhouse types that can authoritatively
be attributed to Tudor days there are few,
but the succeeding age of the Stuarts is rich with
examples of undoubted authenticity. Many of them
are dated, and they all bear a strong family resemblance
to each other, owing to the narrow range of
<i>motifs</i> in the carved panels. There is a fixed
insularity in these early examples, and the same
traditional patterns in scrollwork or in conventional
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
lozenge design retained their hold for many generations.
The oak arm-chair of a farmhouse kitchen
made in the days of Charles I. was still followed in
close detail in the days of George III., as dated
examples testify, and it would puzzle an expert,
without the date to guide him, to say whether the
piece was eighteenth or seventeenth century work.
It may be added that as a general rule there is a
marked leaning towards generosity in imparting age
to old furniture. It is now very generally recognised
that, like wine, it gains prestige with length of years.
It therefore grows in antiquity according to the fancy
of the owner or the imagination of the collector.</p>

<p>Among the early forms of chairs falling under
the category of farmhouse furniture may be noticed
examples of rough and massive build, eminently fit
to serve the purpose for which they were designed.
Ornament is reduced to a minimum, and they stand
as rude monuments to the cabinet-maker's craft in
fashioning them and following tradition to suit his
client's tastes.</p>

<p>In regard to the sixteenth century there cannot be
said to be any type falling under the heading of
cottage or farmhouse chairs. We have already illustrated
(p. <a href="#Page_35">35</a>) an early form of Elizabethan days,
but such examples are rare. Practically cottagers
had only stools in common use. It was not until
about 1650 that a simplified form of the well-known
variety of the chairs of the Jacobean oak period
came into general use.</p>

<p><b>The Typical Jacobean Oak Chair.</b>&mdash;The seventeenth
century offers a wide field of selection, and many
<a id="Page_197"></a>
<a id="Page_198"></a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
examples exist which undoubtedly were in use in
farmhouses at that period. The arm-chair illustrated
p. <a href="#Page_193">191</a>, with the initials "W.I A.", is evidently made
for the farmhouse. It is noticeable for its complete
absence of ornamental carving except a thinly
scratched lozenge. In date this is from 1650 to 1700,
and if made for a wealthier person at that date it
would be richly carved. The adjacent chair shows
the next advance in type. It is a superior farmhouse
chair of the period. It has a carved top with scroll
cresting. The holes in the seat, it should be observed,
originally held ropes, upon which a cushion was
supported. The wooden seat is an addition made in
the eighteenth century.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The two other chairs illustrated on the same page
are later examples, in date about 1690. One of
these is fashioned of chestnut. The form of these
backs is related to the contemporary high-back cane
chairs of the time of Charles II. and James II. But
these fashions influenced the proportions only of
farmhouse chairs. In arriving at the date of such
specimens as these the bevelled panel is an important
factor in determining the late period.</p>

<p>Cushions had no place in the effects of the farmhouse
in early days, although ropes were sometimes
used to support cushions, as we have shown. But as
a general rule the wooden seats show tangible signs
of rough usage of centuries, and the stretcher has its
worn surface marked by generations of owners who
found it protective against the cold flagged or rush-strewn
floor and the draughts in days prior to carpets
and rugs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
<b>The Evolution of the Stretcher.</b>&mdash;In making a study
of the evolution of the chair the stretcher is an
important factor. For obvious reasons, as explained
above, no early chairs were made without the stretcher
across the front, a good sound serviceable piece of
British oak to stand rough wear and tear. Gradually,
keeping time with the march of comfort, the front
stretcher begins to leave its old position near the
floor, and in later examples it is half-way up the front
legs. It still had a use, and a very important one: it
added considerable strength and solidity to the chair,
and is nearly always found in chairs intended for use.
In the series illustrated herein there are only few
examples without the front stretcher. Later it took
another form, as the illustrated specimens in this
chapter show: it united the two side stretchers, and
crossed the chair underneath in the centre at right
angles to the side stretchers. Its purpose in adding
stability to this class of furniture was evidently never
lost sight of.</p>

<p>At first strictly utilitarian, the stretcher was a solid
foot-rest; later, when partly utilitarian in adding to
the strength, it became suitable for ornamentation,
Although in the class of furniture here under review
such ornament never took an elaborate form, there
are examples slightly differing in character from
chairs intended for the use of the wealthier classes,
and these are evidently a local effort to keep in touch
with prevailing taste.</p>

<p>Finely turned stretchers, such as are found in gate
tables, are a feature of a certain class of local chairs,
such as those illustrated on p. <a href="#Page_199">197</a>. This kind of
<a id="Page_201"></a>
<a id="Page_202"></a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
chair without arms is rather more decorated and
conforms more to the styles of furniture made for
higher spheres than the farmhouse. The upper chair
with its light open back and ornate decoration is a
Yorkshire type, and the ball turning in the stretcher
shows the transition period to Charles II. The other
two are Cromwellian chairs, but showing indications
of the next period. In date they are all three
about 1660.</p>

</div></div>

<p><b>The Chair-back and its Development.</b>&mdash;Another point
in connection with the ordered progress of the chair-maker
is the gradual development of the back of
the chair. At first it was straight upright, and no
attempt was made to impart an angle to rest the back
of the sitter. Types such as the arm-chair with
square panel (p. <a href="#Page_191">191</a>) and the upright settle with the
five panels illustrated on p. <a href="#Page_203">201</a> indicate this feature
of discomfort. The next stage is a slight inclination
in the back, still possessing a flat panel. This angle,
while not conforming to modern notions of ease, was
an attempt to offer greater comfort than before. This
style, in a hundred forms, with the minimum of inclination
in the back, continued for a very considerable
period. It is found in the nearly straight-backed
chairs of Derbyshire and Yorkshire origin, with the
turned stretchers, and it actually in later days became
almost upright in the series of chairs following the
later Stuart types with cane back and cane seat,
noticeable for their tall narrow backs with a resemblance
to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">prie-dieu</i> chair of continental usage.</p>

<p>The settle illustrated is a plainer variety of the
settle made for use by fashionable folk with delicately
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
panelled back. Very often, in cottage furniture, chests
and other pieces are broken up to make into smaller
furniture or to be incorporated into furniture of a
later design. Often it is found that the underframing
of an old gate table made in the seventeenth or
eighteenth century is from an earlier chest. In the
present instance it will be seen that the back panels
of the settle have been made from an older chest,
which bears the inscribed initials, still visible, "I.E." In
date this settle is about 1675, and is contemporary
with the square-backed chair illustrated on the same
page. Here the panel in back projects, that is, it is
slightly bevelled forward. The bevelling of the panel
is always a sign that a chair is later in date than the
year 1670.</p>

<p>Illustrated on the same page is a remarkable chair
having the initials "A.S.C.B." and the date 1777 carved
on it. It is a striking instance of the adherence to
old time-honoured form by the local cabinet-maker,
with touches that, even although the date were not
present, would tell their own story. This dull wood
proclaims a message in accents no less sure than the
sturdy yeoman's to Lady Clara Vere de Vere, and as
a chair in date <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">anno Domini</i> 1777 may afford to "smile
at the claims of long descent" of more pretentious and
fashionable furniture. It is like a rich vein of dialect
running in some old country song ripe with phrase of
Saxon days. It seems incredible that this survival of
early-Jacobean days should have been put together
by a village craftsman true to convention and exact
in seat and arms and stretcher. But it was not done
unthinkingly. Here is a chair, astounding to note, made
<a id="Page_205"></a>
<a id="Page_206"></a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
when Sheraton was creating his new styles to supplant
Chippendale, and when Hepplewhite stood between
the two masters as a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">via media</i>. And the back of
this village chair has two distinct features translated
from Hepplewhite's school&mdash;the wheatear crest and
the panel with its broken corner!</p>

<p>OAK CHAIRS. DATE ABOUT 1680.</p>
<p>Showing the inclination of the craftsmen to assimilate designs then being fashioned in walnut.</p>

</div></div>

<p><b>Transition between Jacobean and William and Mary
Forms.</b>&mdash;The rapid growth of the finer specimens of
furniture made in walnut brought a new note into the
farmhouse variety. The elegance and grace of the
newer styles were at once evident. In the same
manner as the grandiose splendour of Elizabethan
woodcarving was succeeded by a less massive style in
oak, degenerating into a rude simplicity in farmhouse
examples, so in turn Jacobean lost favour. Walnut
lent itself to more intricate turning, and lightness and
greater delicacy claimed the popular favour of fashionable
folk. The cane seat and the cane back at once
indicate this new taste. The use of cushions became
general and the sunk seat for the squab cushion is a
feature in the later years of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>Oak still remained the favourite wood of the
country craftsman, in spite of its more refractory
qualities. But when the walnut styles became so
firmly established that clients demanded furniture in
this fashion, elm and beech and yew were found
pliable enough to conform to the more slender touches
and the finer turning considered desirable.</p>

<p>Walnut was in its turn supplanted by mahogany,
and it will be shown later how farmhouse furniture
followed the dictates of fashion in days when the
outburst of splendid design by Chippendale, Hepplewhite,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
and Sheraton, together with a crowd of lesser
known men, spread far and wide new principles in the
art of furniture-making and brought country furniture
another stage in its evolution.</p>

<p>Farmhouse furniture slowly assimilated the technique
and design of the walnut age. The love for the
native oak was so pronounced that country makers
did not desert this wood and essayed to produce
effects by its employment that were exceedingly
difficult and oftentimes unsuccessful. The three
chairs illustrated p. <a href="#Page_207">205</a> show this transition style,
about the year 1680, struggling with technical difficulties
and affording a fine series of points in the
evolution of design.</p>

<p><b>Farmhouse Styles contemporary with the Cane-back
Chair.</b>&mdash;Farmhouse furniture rarely, if ever, had cane-work
in the back or in the seat. But the craftsman,
while appreciating the delicacy of the cane back in
adding lightness to the chair, circumvented his
inability to work in cane by substituting thin vertical
splats to give the necessary effect of transparency.
The three chairs illustrated show each in varying
degree the quaint compromise made between the
technique of oak and the technique of walnut, and
the attempt to reproduce the walnut designs.</p>

<p>The arm-chair exhibits strong relationship with the
older Jacobean chair in its turned legs and uprights,
but these have assumed a more slender proportion.
The front stretcher is in the newer manner. The
sunk seat is intended to receive a cushion. There
should be no difficulty for the amateur correctly
to assign a date to such a piece. The process of
<a id="Page_209"></a>
<a id="Page_210"></a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
reasoning would be somewhat as follows:&mdash;The
lower half of the chair is Jacobean, but the front
stretcher suggests the Charles II. period, borne out
by the open back, which removes it from the Cromwellian
period, and the details of the top rail with its
curved top indicate that the country maker had seen
the tall straight-back chairs of the William and Mary
period with the cane-work panel.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The middle chair more closely approaches the
upright chair of the Charles II. period. There is a
straight top-rail, supplemented by a lunette, giving
the top a character of its own. This specimen is
exceptionally interesting. The right-hand chair in
its seat and legs is pronouncedly Jacobean. But the
back with the three splats and the coarsely carved
top-rail betray the hand of the country craftsman
following in oak the more graceful curves of the
worker in walnut of the days of Charles II.</p>

<p>It will be seen that these three chairs, each in
varying manner, evade the difficulties of the light
cane-back by the substitution of thin rails, and, as
will be seen from the illustration of three other
chairs (p. <a href="#Page_211">209</a>), the next stage of walnut design with
fiddle-shaped splat offered equal problems to the
makers of cottage furniture. Sometimes they eliminated
the splat altogether, while adopting other points
of design found in chairs with the Queen Anne splat
of 1710. In every case the fondness for old established
styles is exhibited in the fact that the country
cabinet-maker clings doggedly to these and appears
too conservative or too timid to break wholly away
from tradition. In consequence, his work, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
patches of newer design welded on to the old, is
quaintly incongruous. There is thus an absence of
"thinking out" the design as a whole. The minor
maker thought out the parts as he went along. Some
of his results are extraordinary in their characteristics:
they resemble that freak of fashion termed
"harlequin" tea services, where the cups are of one
pattern and the saucers of another. Bearing in mind
these unfailing proclivities of the maker of cottage
and farmhouse furniture, the collector should not find
it difficult to recognise the country hand at once.
Now and again one is struck with the extraordinary
ingenuity of some of the work, or one is charmed
with the faithfulness with which designs have been
translated from the golden bowl to the silver, or, to
be literal, from walnut and mahogany to oak and elm
and beech. But one is never amazed at the delicacy
of proportion, the balanced symmetry, or the fertility
of invention&mdash;these attributes belong to cabinet-makers
on a higher plane.</p>

<p>Of three chairs illustrated on p. <a href="#Page_211">209</a>, that on the
left in the legs and seat shows the moribund
Jacobean style. The stretcher indicates the oncoming
of the newer styles, and the back with its cresting
rail is of the Charles II. period. Its retention is
curious, and the perforated arched centre is peculiar
to designs found in walnut; its use in oak by the
maker of this chair was a blunder, as oak is too hard
a wood to employ for such a design.</p>

<p>The middle chair shows an equal admixture of
styles. The elaboration in the turned legs and
uprights belongs to the William and Mary period

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
and the splat is the Queen Anne fiddle pattern of
1710. The seat begins to show another form in
having the middle sunk for the use of a squab
cushion.</p>

<p>The right-hand chair parts with the underframing
below the seat, which gives a touch of lightness to the
construction. The turned legs and uprights have
departed from the coarse early-Jacobean style and
perceptibly depend on walnut prototypes for their
character. The back shows the transition from the
lath back (such as in the chairs simulating the cane-work)
to the splat back. It is an interesting and
rare example, marking the slow assimilation of new
forms by isolated makers. This specimen came from
Ireland and evidently possesses native touches of
originality which defy the connoisseur to determine
its exact date.</p>

<p><b>The Queen Anne Splat.</b>&mdash;The fiddle-shaped splat of
1710 marks a turning-point in the construction of
the chair.</p>

<p>The walnut chairs with caned backs of the time
of James II. and the early days of William III.
were carved richly, and sometimes there was a splat
dividing the caning at the back, which later, also in
caned-back examples, is curved and plain. The
general tendency in the reigns of William and Mary,
especially towards the close of the period, was one of
economy, and elaborate carving began to disappear.</p>

<p>The Queen Anne smooth splat of fiddle form
rapidly became popular. This Anglo-Dutch style
became acclimatised here, and is characteristic of the
homely examples of the Queen Anne period. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
walnut it was comparatively easy to carry out
carving. In oak such elaboration was well-nigh
impossible. It was therefore natural that in the
farmhouse examples the plain Dutch splat would
readily find favour as more easily executed. By the
time that the fiddle splat had become popular the
stretcher joining the cabriole legs commenced to
disappear.</p>

<p>The splat plays an important part as indicating
sharp variations in design&mdash;walnut with open carving,
intricate and floriated; walnut with the plain
fiddle splat, with its corresponding minor form in
oak; mahogany, with the advent of Chippendale,
with the splat again open, carved with graceful
ribbon-work.</p>

<p>The arm-chair illustrated p. <a href="#Page_217">213</a> is a remarkable
instance of intermingling of styles. The front legs
are in Jacobean style, and are continued in the same
manner as the usual type of oak chair as supports for
the arms, but an original touch and naïve departure
is in the curve given to this upright from the seat
upwards. The seat is shaped like that of the
Windsor chair. The arms are somewhat stiff for the
back with its Cupid's-bow design, which has a
sprightliness and grace making it a thing apart. The
whole is not unpleasing. It is a remarkable instance
of the attempted assimilation of several diverse styles
by an undeveloped cabinet-maker with strong ideas
of his own. The oak form is rigidly retained in all
except the back and splat of Queen Anne days.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The adjacent chair, with its tall back with curved
splat and its cabriole legs, marks the transition
<a id="Page_219"></a>
<a id="Page_220"></a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
between William and Mary and Queen Anne. The
top rail indicates by its clumsy joinery the touch of
the immature country cabinet-maker. It is an
attempt to approach a fine model with insufficiency
of skill by the maker. The use of the cabriole leg
either in chairs or in dressers in homely furniture has
always proved a stumbling-block to the minor craftsman.
The delicacy of balance required in order to
preserve the harmony of the whole has proved too
subtle a problem for him to handle, and to the
practised eye these farmhouse pieces at once proclaim
their origin.</p>

<p>The broad splat and the straight square front and
the bold cabriole leg of the Queen Anne type in
walnut were often copied in oak. The example of
the chair with the later tapestry covering, illustrated
p. <a href="#Page_217">213</a>, is a case where the local cabinet-maker has
faithfully copied detail for detail from some fine
original in walnut. His is in oak for more strenuous
usage. The adjacent arm-chair is of the Queen Anne
style, with a shaped front that is very rarely found
in such pieces. The maker here has not been so
successful in catching the bold lines of his original.
There is a sense of something lacking in the curves
of the back. The touches of his own that he has
added in the arms, reverting to an earlier Jacobean
type, reveal the unpractised hand.</p>

<p><b>Country Chippendale, Hepplewhite, and Sheraton.</b>&mdash;A
word in passing may be said in regard to the unique
character of furniture of these types. It is obvious
that factory-made furniture turned out by the hundred
pieces can offer nothing personal, whatever its merits
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
or demerits of design or workmanship. It is this
personal note, the love of a craftsman in his creation,
that appeals to the collector, whether it be of Persian
rugs or of old brass candlesticks. It is absent in
art produced in a wholesale manner. Blunderingly
as the village craftsmen went to work, they often
stumbled into great things, and they always produced
original results.</p>

<p>Prior to the publication of the design-books of the
great eighteenth-century masters of cabinet-making,
the furniture of certain localities began to assume
a character of its own, the result of long tradition,
and designs such as the dragon found in Welsh
carving became established. The term "unique" is
peculiarly appropriate to furniture of this calibre, for
rarely are two pieces found to be exactly alike. Not
only did different makers add novel features, but
the same craftsman apparently did not repeat
himself.</p>

<p>The permutations of form governing furniture are
illimitable, associated as they are with so many
details of construction. To take the chair&mdash;the leg,
its shape, and the design of its turning; the style
and character of the work on the stretcher; the form
of the seat; the decoration and formation of the
front; the back, its length, and the variety of splats
and panels; and the top rail with its variations&mdash;these
are only the salient features in which differences
appear. Such modifications of design and piquant
touches of personal character appeal to the collector,
who loves the foibles and fanciful moods of the native
craftsman, be he ever so humble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
Chippendale published his "Director" in 1754, and
it became a working guide to all ambitious craftsmen.
Ince and Mayhew, cabinet-makers of Broad
Street, Golden Square, had issued "Household
Furniture" in 1748, and Hepplewhite &amp; Co.
followed later with the "Cabinet Maker and Upholsterer's
Guide" in 1788, where the delicacies of
ornament were related to the chaster classic models,
and in 1794 came Sheraton with his "Drawing
Book," rich with subtle suggestiveness. A rough
generalisation shows the Chippendale school holding
sway from 1730 to 1780, the Hepplewhite school
from 1775 to 1795, and the Sheraton school from
1790 to 1805: and behind all, the strong influence of
the Brothers Adam in their classic revival. What
had previously been tradition came very speedily
into line with current modes. Fashion, as we have
shown, had a slow and impermanent effect upon
village ideals. But the output of these great
illustrated volumes, with working drawings, undoubtedly
had a wide-reaching influence. The last
quarter of the eighteenth century saw an intense
outburst of interest in the arts of interior decoration.
A great amount of finely designed and beautifully
executed furniture belongs to those days, and the
echo of the splendid achievements in mahogany and
in satinwood is seen in the farmhouse and cottage
furniture, which came singularly close upon the heels
of fashion.</p>

<p>Chippendale furniture in oak, elm, or beech is
being largely collected. We illustrate a sufficient
number of types to show that this class of design
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
known as "Cottage Chippendale," has peculiar charms
of its own. The arm-chair illustrated p. <a href="#Page_227">225</a> is in
elm, and is in the style Chippendale employed in
his rich mahogany creations in 1760. The fine
interlaced carving of the back is graceful and well
proportioned. The adjacent chair, in elm, still
follows the Chippendale style. The seat is rush,
and the maker has confined himself to his own
limitations and avoided in the splat the too intricate
work of more sumptuous models. He has arrived
at a very finely balanced result. The heart cut out
of the splat is frequently found in cottage examples,
suggesting that some of the more ornate examples
may have been made as wedding presents for young
couples just setting up housekeeping, or possibly the
village cabinet-maker himself had thoughts in that
direction, and such work was destined to equip his
own home.</p>

<p>The illustration of a chair, in beech, with a plain
wooden seat, has a somewhat intricate ribbon-like
pattern terminating in the Prince of Wales's feathers.
The heart is present in the design at the base of
the splat, cut out in fretwork. The arm-chair on
the right, with its dipped seat, is in oak, and is an
instance representing the adaptations of Sheraton
styles in the provinces.</p>

<p>Another page of chairs in oak (p. <a href="#Page_217">215</a>) shows the
influences at work in moulding the character of the
styles of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth
century farmhouse furniture. Of the three chairs at
top of p. <a href="#Page_217">215</a>, the left-hand one is in Chippendale
style merging into Hepplewhite. The Cupid's bow
<a id="Page_225"></a>
<a id="Page_226"></a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
at the top rail has become less pronounced. The
other two chairs on right are typically Hepplewhite
in character. The Prince of Wales's feathers, so
often associated with Hepplewhite's own work, are
embodied in the splat of one.</p>

</div></div>

<p>In the lower group, the right-hand chair is of the
Chippendale type. The other two chairs have
features of three styles&mdash;the Queen Anne, the
Chippendale, and the Sheraton. It is this piquancy
and incongruous combination of styles adjacent to
each other in point of time, but having little other
relationship, which make the provincialisms of the
cabinet-maker of exceptional interest.</p>

<p>At times more ambitious attempts were made in
oak, following the lines of the Chippendale style in
mahogany. These have pronounced features always
recognisable as belonging to the farmhouse variety
of furniture. Two examples are illustrated, p. <a href="#Page_218">219</a>.
The upper example of country-made oak settee,
with double back, at once indicates that it is
provincial by the shaped underframing, which is
never found in other classes of furniture. The lower
example of farmhouse oak settee is clearly in
Chippendale's Chinese style. A reference to the
"Gentleman and Cabinet Maker's Directory," published
by Thomas Chippendale in 1754, shows that
this Chinese style adopted by the local maker is very
far removed from the series of delicate fretwork
designs illustrated by Chippendale in his volume.
It is true that the old designer of St. Martin's Lane
sent forth his work with the sub-title stating that
it was "calculated to improve and refine the present
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
Taste, and suited to the Fancy and Circumstances
of Persons in all Degrees of Life." The great
master cabinet-maker, in scattering his designs far
and wide, evidently had in mind the formation of a
new style. He builded better than he knew. The
importance of his book of designs cannot be overrated.
It was subscribed for in Yorkshire, in Devon,
in Westmorland, and in Ireland, and straightway
minor men looked upon these delightful inventions
and began to follow to the best of their ability the
ideals set forth by Chippendale the dreamer.</p>

<p>That he was an idealist in this book of designs is
naïvely explained in his Preface: "I frankly confess
that in the executing many of the drawings my
pencil has but faintly copied out those images that
my fancy suggested, and had they not been published
till I could have pronounced them perfect, perhaps
they had never seen the light." But Chippendale
was also a practical cabinet-maker as well as a
designer. He has a lingering doubt that after all,
perhaps, the country cabinet-maker and those who
bought the book for use might not be able to carry
out his designs. Evidently this had struck others
too. Perhaps he was accused of fobbing-off in a
design-book mere fanciful work that was too far
above the plane of ordinary cabinet-work. He meets
this objection with a declaration, so to speak, upon
honour, with which he winds up his Preface, which
is a pretty piece of eighteenth-century advertising:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Upon the whole, I have given no design but what
may be executed with advantage by the hands of a
skilful workman, though some of the profession have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
been diligent enough to represent them (especially
those after the Gothic and Chinese manner) as so
many specious drawings, impossible to be worked off
by any mechanic whatsoever. I will not scruple to
attribute this to malice, ignorance, and inability, and
I am confident I can convince all noblemen, gentlemen,
or others, who will honour me with their
commands, that every design in the book can be
improved, both as to beauty and enrichment, in the
execution of it, by&mdash;Their Most Obedient Servant,
Thomas Chippendale."</p>

<p>Enough has been said to prove that "country
Chippendale" is not a misnomer. It is equally true
that the Hepplewhite style was disseminated in like
fashion in the provinces. It must be remembered
that these trade catalogues, as they really were,
brought out somewhat in rivalry with each other by
the great London designers and cabinet-makers, were
the only literature the country makers had to indicate
town fashions. These volumes therefore served a
double purpose in procuring clients for the firm and
in stimulating the art of the country designer. That
they were in part intended to be educational is shown
by the Preface to the "Cabinet Maker and Upholsterer's
Guide," published by A. Hepplewhite &amp; Co.,
Cabinet-makers. We quote from the Preface of
the third edition, "improved," 1794.</p>

<p>The Preface opens with a lament that owing to
"the mutability of all things, but more especially of
fashions," foreigners who seek a knowledge of English
taste and workmanship may be misled by the "labours
of our predecessors in this line of little use."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
"The same reason in favour of this work will
apply also to many of our own countrymen and
artisans, whose distance from the metropolis makes
even an imperfect knowledge of its improvements
acquired with much trouble and expense."</p>

<p>"In this instance we hope for reward; and though
we lay no claim to extraordinary merit in our designs,
we flatter ourselves they will be found serviceable to
young workmen in general, and occasionally to more
experienced ones."</p>

<p>In view, therefore, of the books of design we have
enumerated, it is obvious that the country designer
had a new field open to him, and now and again he
made ample use of his opportunities. During the
last quarter of the eighteenth century there was quite
an outburst of literature on furniture, much of it
forgotten and much of it waiting to be disinterred
by patient research; and with the dissemination of
these fine designs some of the most perfect examples
of country-made furniture began to exhibit touches
of skill of the practised hand.</p>

<p><b>The Grandfather Chair.</b>&mdash;From the illustration given
on p. <a href="#Page_230">231</a> it will be seen that the type known as
the "grandfather" has a humble lineage. It will be
found with the same wings and curved arms and
plain wooden seat in the alehouse or in the ingle nook
of the farmhouse. The specimen we illustrate does
duty as a bacon-cupboard as well as a chair. Usually
such pieces have the cupboard opening at the back,
but in this instance the cupboard opens in front.</p>

<p>As early as the opening years of the eighteenth
century there were upholstered chairs of a somewhat
<a id="Page_231"></a>
<a id="Page_232"></a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
similar type to the so-called "grandfather" with
scrolled arms or wings. The example we illustrate
is representative of those which may be met with in
the country farmhouse.</p>

<p><b>Ladder-back Types.</b>&mdash;The ladder-back chair belongs
to the northern half of England, and similarly the
spindle-back chair is found in the same locality.
The Windsor chair, on the other hand, is mainly
confined to the southern half of the country. These
are points which become noticeable after years of
systematised research, and although nowadays these
three varieties of chair may still be found, somewhat
scattered, their real home and place of origin is as
indicated. Another feature of interest is that both
ladder-back and spindle-back varieties, with but
slight differences, are found on the Continent.</p>

<p>It will be observed that this class of chair has a
rush seat. This feature it has in common with the
spindle-back chair.</p>

<p>The rush-bottom chair covers a wide area. It
comes with an air of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naïveté</i> and rustic simplicity.
One recalls the long lines of green rushes by the
river-bank and the rush-gatherers in idyllic placidity
slowly trimming the banks, disturbing coot and
moorhen with their punt, and adding another human
touch to the lonely angler. They are pursuing a
calling as old as the river itself, and the use of rush
for floor, for lighting, or for seating furniture, found
occupation for generations of men plying curious
trades, of which the plaiting of osiers into baskets
and the thatching of cottage roofs may be numbered
among the decaying industries. Indeed, this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
latter art and the making of birch and heath brooms
may be almost said to be extinct. A good artisan
who can thatch in the old artistic style is much
sought after. Of course ricks have still to be thatched,
but the picturesque skill of masters of this old-world
craft is absent, and corrugated iron sheets have found
favour in lieu of the old style.</p>

<p>The ladder-back chair is, as its name denotes,
decorated with horizontal supports, ladder fashion.
These are capable of the most pleasing variation.
The perfection of form of this type is seen in the
arm-chair illustrated p. <a href="#Page_234">237</a>. The well-balanced
proportion of the ladder rails is a test as to the
excellence of the design. They are not meaningless
ornaments put in place, unthinkingly, to create a new
style. The two examples illustrated on page 235
show other types of the ladder-back chair. The
left-hand one shows the later stages in the development
of the design, and its top rail is of the Sheraton
period. The right-hand one, with arms, is composite
in its character, and is in date about 1820, and
exhibits a touch of the Sheraton slenderness of style
in the splats and the round turning of arms. Both
examples show the quaint survival of the Queen
Anne foot. The ladder-back form survived the
eighteenth century and lasted down to within fifty
years ago, when it became merged into that of the
Windsor chair.</p>

</div></div>

<p><b>The Spindle-back Chair.</b>&mdash;The spindle-back chair is
of long lineage. As early as the reign of Charles I.
this type was known. There is still treasured in
America the chair of Governor Carver, with simple
<a id="Page_235"></a>
<a id="Page_236"></a>
<a id="Page_237"></a>
<a id="Page_238"></a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
turning in legs and back, which practically consisted
of upright posts rounded and having slight ornament.
The back was set with "spindles." The older types
of these chairs had thick upright posts, the back and
back legs being two posts and the front legs, continued
upward beyond the seat, forming supports for
the arms. These posts are often six or seven inches
in circumference, and belong to early-Jacobean days.
The type found its way to America in Puritan days
and has continued to be a favourite. Hickory wood
was used for American specimens, and considerable
attention has been paid to this form of chair and its
varieties, the differing heights of the posts and the
number of the spindles and their character, by
American collectors. In England examples are not
easily found of early date. The examples illustrated
(p. <a href="#Page_234">235</a>), a Nursing Chair on rockers and an ordinary
Spindle-Back Chair, are of eighteenth-century days,
and are sufficient to indicate the type of chair, but
these two represent the style when it had become
of more general use. Practically it was not until the
eighteenth century that such types were commonly
used in cottages and farmhouses.</p>

<p>These turned chairs, turned in every portion but
the rush seat, lend themselves to the above-mentioned
two styles of treatment. Their upright posts forming
the open back can be treated with vertical splats
divided by horizontal divisions, or they can, as in the
ladder form, receive horizontal splats. The complete
simplicity of this attitude towards the back absolved
the homely cabinet-maker from dangerous experiments.
Avoiding curved backs, he had not to face
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
the intricacies of the nicety of balance in the splat.
Altogether it was a very satisfactory solution, and in
practice resulted in the production of a wide range
of chairs, differing in slight details but well within
the range of the local workman's art.</p>

<p>The unassuming simplicity of this class of chair
made its appeal to Madox-Brown, who held that
simplicity and utility were the two desiderata, united
with soundness of construction, for domestic furniture.
Veneer was as abhorrent to him as to all genuine
lovers of the artistic. "Let us be honest, let us be
genuine in furniture as in aught else," were his words.
"If we must needs make our chairs and tables of
cheap wood, do not let them masquerade as mahogany
or rosewood; let the thing appear that which it is;
it will not lack dignity if it be good of its kind and
well made." Accordingly he put his theories into
practice and designed some furniture. In a chair in
the possession of Mr. Harold Rathbone he has
employed the rush seat and used spindles to decorate
the back, and in another chair in the same collection
he has adhered to the horizontal ladder-back style,
coupled with the rush seat, with pleasing effect.</p>

<p><b>Corner Chairs.</b>&mdash;Among interesting types of chairs
often with lingering traces of the Jacobean style
and additional features of splats that may be
regarded as standing on the threshold of the
Chippendale period, corner chairs stand in a class
alone. The illustrations on p. <a href="#Page_234">237</a> show some typical
examples. The chair with the double tier is the oak
adaptation of Chippendale with the retention of the
old Jacobean form of support for the arm. These
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
chairs with this added tier are often used as country
barber's chairs. The rush-seated corner chair on the
same page, probably made in Lancashire, is suggestive
of the ladder-back form, and there are indications in
its construction that it is subsequent to the Hepplewhite
period.</p>

<p>With these notes relative to the evolution of the
chair, and with carefully selected illustrations of
types likely to be of use to the collector, enough has
been said to whet the curiosity of the reader to study
the matter for himself. It requires keen and discriminating
judgment to allocate specimens with
passing exactitude as to time and place. The taste
for the subject must be natural and not acquired.
Training alone will give the eye the readiness to
detect false touches and modern additions. The
search for bargains goes on apace, and those who
enjoy stalking their quarry in out-of-the-way places
have an exciting quest nowadays for fine pieces.
To those with endless patience, forbearing under
disappointment, and having plenty of leisure, the
search will offer abundant delight, if, to quote Mrs.
Battle, they enjoy "the rigour of the game."</p>

<span class="medium">THE WINDSOR CHAIR</span></p>

<p class="hanging2">Early types&mdash;The stick legs without stretcher&mdash;The
tavern chair&mdash;Eighteenth-century pleasure gardens&mdash;The
rail-back variety&mdash;Chippendale style
Windsor chairs&mdash;The survival of the Windsor
chair.</p>

<p>The Windsor chair in its early form is coincident
with the early years of the eighteenth century. Its
history and development therefore exhibit traces of
the various styles in furniture which ran their courses
throughout the century. It is essentially a chair
which belongs to minor furniture, and in its use it
is bound up with the country farmhouse, the country
inn, or in the metropolis with the chocolate-houses
and taverns, and later with the innumerable pleasure
gardens which sprang up around the metropolis in
the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>There is more than a strong suggestion that the
type originated in the country. The first forms have
a similarity to the easily made three-legged stools.
The seat is one piece of wood into which holes are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
bored to admit the legs. The origin of the term
"Windsor chair," according to a story largely current
in America, is that George III., the Farmer King, saw
a chair of this design in a humble cottage near
Windsor, and was so enamoured of it that he ordered
some to be made for the royal use. The chair had
a singular vogue in America, and it is stated that
George Washington had a row of Windsor chairs at
his house at Mount Vernon, and Jefferson sat in a
Windsor chair when he signed the Declaration of
Independence in 1776.</p>

<p><b>The Stick Legs without Stretcher.</b>&mdash;Obviously this
is the earliest type, and the illustrations of these
primitive forms (p. <a href="#Page_249">247</a>) show the simplicity of the
joinery. The chair on the left with its almost
straight top rail suggests a probable date. It was
not till 1768 that Chippendale made the first straight
top rail in English furniture. The seat is of the
saddle-form. The spindles at the back in the lower
row taper at each end. It will be observed in all
the types we illustrate in this chapter that the arms
extend in one piece around the chair. Nor has
every example the saddle seat. On the same page
is illustrated one with a plain seat, but still having
the stick legs set at an angle towards the centre of
the chair.</p>

<p>Whatever interest attaches to this early type, from
a collecting point of view, they cannot compare in
beauty with the finer varieties of a later period, with
cabriole leg and with pierced splat, displaying a
pleasing diversity of patterns in pierced work, no
two of which are always quite alike.</p>

</div></div>

<p><b>The Tavern Chair.</b>&mdash;It was Dr. Johnson who declared
that a tavern chair was the throne of human felicity.
Undoubtedly the eighteenth century found the need
of a comfortable chair for club meetings at taverns
and alehouses. The country inn to-day has its
Windsor chairs, many of them of great age. Nor
were chairs of this type always with arms. There
are many plainer chairs without arms and having
what is termed "fiddle-string" backs; more often
than not across this back there is a rail put transversely
to strengthen it. Many of these chairs were
made by local carpenters and wheelwrights. They
employed any wood that happened to be in their
workshop at the time; in consequence the variety
of woods in which these chairs are found is great.
Sometimes the seat is made from beech or elm and
the arms are fashioned from the wood of the pear-tree.
The curved horseshoe rails and back are more
often than not constructed from the ash.</p>

<p><b>Eighteenth Century Pleasure Gardens.</b>&mdash;There is no
doubt that we owe the considerable output of
Windsor chairs in the middle of the eighteenth
century to the growth of coffee-houses, and especially
the numerous tea and pleasure gardens on the outskirts
of London and other great towns. These
semi-rural resorts began to be in great demand as
a recreation for jaded eighteenth-century town-dwellers.
The nobility and persons of fashion had
Bath and Tunbridge Wells to fly to for country air
and open-air recreation. The citizen and mechanic,
the society beau, and the politician, crowded to
Ranelagh Gardens, to Vauxhall, to Sadler's Wells,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
and to Hampstead, to enjoy sunny afternoons and
summer evenings in the open air, or to spend
Sundays. It was the eighteenth-century diversion
similar to the nineteenth-century Crystal Palace
and the twentieth-century Earl's Court. To quote
Mr. Percy Macquoid in his lordly work on English
furniture, "So great were the numbers of visitors to
these places that attention was called to their increase
in one of the contemporary weekly journals, where a
calculation was made that on Sundays alone two
hundred thousand people visited the tea-gardens
situated on the northern side of London; and as
half-a-crown per head was probably the least sum
expended by them, it can be no exaggeration to
state that £20,000 on a fine Sunday was taken at
these places of amusement. Many cheap chairs must
have been required at such places of entertainment."</p>

<p>Between the year 1760 and the end of the century
the Windsor chair was being made for general
country use. "The backs and arms of these," continues
Mr. Macquoid, "are made of hoops of yew,
held together by a number of slender uprights and a
perforated splat of the same tough and pliant wood;
the seats were generally invariably of elm, as yew cut
into a superficies of any size is liable to split; the
legs and stretchers were generally of yew."</p>

friend, Dr. Hawes.</p>
<p>(<i>Bethnal Green Museum.</i>)</p>
</div></div>

<p><b>The Rail-back Variety.</b>&mdash;We have alluded to the use
of the rail placed across the back from the top rail to
the seat, crossing the uprights. It is not an elegant
device, but it was used as a means of strengthening
the back. It seems almost unnecessary, although
possibly these chairs received a good deal of rough
<a id="Page_251"></a>
<a id="Page_252"></a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
usage. Later, when the fiddle splat began to be
employed, this transverse rail&mdash;sometimes there were
two used&mdash;was discontinued. An historic example of
the chair with transverse rails is that which was once
in the possession of Oliver Goldsmith. There is no
doubt about the authenticity of this, as it was
bequeathed by the poet to his medical attendant,
Dr. Hawes, who, by the way, was the founder of the
Royal Humane Society. Goldsmith told his farmer
friends at his cottage at Edgware that he should never
in future spend more than two months a year in
London, and at the time of his death in 1774 he was
negotiating the sale of the lease of his Temple chambers.
This chair (illustrated p. <a href="#Page_250">251</a>) has a rather small
shaped seat, curved arms, a top rail that is of exceptional
interest considering the date, which is, say, from
1770 to 1774, perhaps a little earlier. This was at the
commencement of the Hepplewhite period, which
lasted till 1790. The year 1768 was, as we have
already said, the date at which chairs with straight
top rails, designed by Adam and executed by
Chippendale, were first made. The turned legs are
interesting, showing the hoofed foot, and the turned
stretcher retains an earlier form. The chair is of
soft wood, probably beech, and is painted green. It
is preserved at the Bethnal Green Museum, with the
distinctive label on the stand: "Oliver Goldsmith's
Chair."</p>

<p><b>The Splat Back and the Cabriole Leg.</b>&mdash;It is here that
the Windsor chair assumes a character essentially
charming and attracts the admiration of connoisseurs
of styles that are peculiarly English. The splat back
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
is a feature only found in English varieties of the
Windsor chair. In America a great deal of attention
has been paid to old types, and there the pliant
hickory wood is used in the making of chairs of this
form; but the splat back is never used in America,
and when found by collectors there the piece is
attributed to English manufacture.</p>

<p>The splat, with its varying forms, denotes the date
of the chair. From 1740 to 1770 the form with
cabriole legs and with finely ornamented fiddle splat
was at its best. We illustrate a sufficient number of
specimens to show how graceful and perfectly well
balanced these chairs had become. In contemplating
pieces remarkable for the highest style, it must be
admitted that their artistry and their simple unaffected
sense of comfort do make a direct appeal
to those who are willing to recognise fine qualities
in minor furniture.</p>

<p>The two chairs illustrated (p. <a href="#Page_254">255</a>) differ slightly
in details of construction. That on the left has the
plain urn splat, a survival of the Queen Anne type.
The seat is finely shaped and the legs are cabriole
form. The top rail is almost straight, and is
ornamented at the two ends with turned discs.
The three stretchers are turned, and in the adjacent
chair the stretchers are similar, save in a slight variation
in the pattern of the turning. But here the
splat is perforated with an intricate design suggestive
of the lines of Chippendale; the top rail is a departure
in form, imparting a distinctiveness which
lifts the chair from the ordinary type.</p>

<p><b>Chippendale Style Windsor Chairs.</b>&mdash;The page of
<a id="Page_255"></a>
<a id="Page_256"></a>
<a id="Page_257"></a>
<a id="Page_258"></a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
chairs (p. <a href="#Page_254">257</a>) tells its own story. The beautiful
sweep of the curved back is always a sign of the
old and true form. Later imitations or replicas
seem somehow to lose this effect. It has been suggested
that the back of this style was produced by
the village wheelwright in horseshoe form, but possibly
that is a conjecture which is more fanciful than
real. It has also&mdash;collectors are often fond of inventing
theories to fit little-known facts&mdash;been asserted
that the wheel-back variety, which is of somewhat
more modern growth, is due to the same origin.
This wheel is fretted with six triangular openings.
One chair on this page has the wheel unperforated.
In the examination of the details of the four
examples there is nothing of great importance to
differentiate them from each other in construction.
The two at the top are suggestive of Chippendale in
the ornament employed in the splat. The lower two
incline more to the slightly later Hepplewhite period.
Of these the one on the left has only fourteen upright
rails at the lower portion and six in the upper portion
of the back, in comparison with sixteen and eight in
the other chairs. The legs of this chair are exceptionally
fine both back and front. The work in the
splat is slightly suggestive of Welsh carving, especially
that style associated with Welsh love-spoons.</p>

<p>Following the influence of Chippendale and
Hepplewhite came the style of Sheraton, which
after 1790 began to affect the character of some
forms of minor furniture. That this was a very real
factor is often shown most unexpectedly in cottage
and farmhouse pieces. The satinwood and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
painted panel, and the intricacies and subtleties of
his employment of colour, were of course too far
removed from the simple cabinet-work of the country
maker to have the least effect upon him, even if he
ever saw them. But the slenderness and elegance of
the Sheraton styles did in a small degree have weight
with cabinet-makers as a whole in the provinces.
So that it is quite within reasonable surmise to
attribute certain forms to the Sheraton school, or
rather to the oncoming of the early nineteenth-century
mannerisms. On p. <a href="#Page_260">261</a> two examples are
illustrated showing this influence. The one with the
horseshoe back is devoid of the splat, which had
now disappeared. The turned legs begin to show
signs of modernity. The other has the top-rail
familiar in later forms of cottage chair. The turned
rails for the arms and the type of turning in the legs
show signs of decadence. The fine days of the old
Windsor chair were coming to an end.</p>

<p><b>The Survival of the Windsor Chair Type.</b>&mdash;Apart
from the love of the simple form and especially well-conceived
design of the Windsor chair, which have
made it at once the especial favourite of artists and
lovers of simplicity and utility, it has won the practical
approval of generations of innkeepers, who to
this day store hundreds of chairs for use at village
festivals. What we have said in regard to the popularity
of the gate-leg table applies in greater degree
to the Windsor chair. The industry of turning the
legs and rails of this type of chair is still carried on
in Buckinghamshire. Until recent years much of
this turning was done by hand by villagers in the
<a id="Page_261"></a>
<a id="Page_262"></a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
district surrounding High Wycombe, where the parts
are sent to be finished and made up. To this day
some of the old chair-makers use the antiquated pole
lathe. But the chairs have departed from their old
stateliness. It is true that they have survived, almost
in spite of themselves. They are not now the objects
of beauty they once were. But they have, by reason
of modern requirements, found a fresh field of usefulness.
Will it be supposed that the modern office
chair is in reality a Windsor? An examination will
at once show this, even in the latest American types.
The saddle-shaped seat is there, the straight turned
legs, and the back is the same except that the upper
extension has disappeared and the old centre rail has
become broader as a properly-formed rest for the
tired clerk's back. A perusal of a few catalogues of
up-to-date office furniture will establish this. Here,
then, is the last stage of the country Windsor chair.
The twentieth-century Windsor has come to town
and graces the head cashier's private office in a
bank or the senior partner's room of a firm of
stockbrokers.</p>

<p class="hanging2">Welsh carving&mdash;Scottish types&mdash;Lancashire dressers,
wardrobes, and chairs&mdash;Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire,
Cambridge, and Essex tables&mdash;Isle of Man tables.</p>

<p>The charm of collecting cottage and farmhouse
furniture lies in the wide area over which it is found.
Those who have given especial attention to collecting
it have learned instinctively to differentiate between
the work of various localities. Some well-defined
types of cottage furniture are only to be found in
certain counties, and nowhere else. Take for example
the ladder-back and the spindle chairs. The latter
are usually found in the northern half and the former
in the southern half of England. It is obvious that
craftsmen developing on original lines, or on lines
more or less apart from outside influence, must
establish designs peculiarly identified with their
field of labours.</p>

<p>The sturdy insularity of the British peasant, and
his uneasy reception of foreign suggestion, have had
a very pronounced influence upon his methods of
work. He has the defects of his qualities, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
stern, almost uncompromising conservatism in habit
of mind and in his daily pursuits. A close study of
the thoughts, and as far as is recorded the written
ideals, of the rural labouring population exhibit
an extraordinary fixity of purpose in clinging
tenaciously to old customs. The country songs
more often than not express disapproval of innovations
and call up the memories of slowly vanishing
customs. The farm hands recall wistfully the old
style of Shearers' feasts and Harvest homes, when
great festivities with song and dance and old country
sports enlivened the company. In Yorkshire this
was termed the Mel Supper, in Kent the Kern
Supper, and in parts of the North of England it
was called the Churn Supper. Annual feasts were
given to labourers such as the Wayzgoose or Bean
feast, which later name remains to this day. The
good old days is a refrain not confined to the cottager
in his relation with the farmer. The farmer, imbued
with the same wistful regard for the vanished past,
bewails the May Day tenants' feast of the eighteenth-century
English squire.</p>

<p>We get touches of disdain for the oncoming fashion
of seclusion which invaded the farmhouse in "A
Farmer's Boy," by Robert Bloomfield. He laments
that the annual feast of the harvest home had lost
its former joviality. This was written in 1798.</p>

<p>"The aspect only with the substance gone."
Evidently the mug that passed around was becoming
a thing of the past.</p>

The picture he draws of the farmer who, in face of
prevailing fashion, "yields up the custom that he
dearly loves" is pathetic. The long table and
dining in common together had seemingly vanished.
"The <i>separate</i> table and the costly bowl" touch
the rustic poet's pride. He italicises the word
"separate."</p>

<p>This loving regard for the past is natural at a
time when the rural population jealously feared the
oncoming of the age of machinery, which threatened
to supersede many of their local industries and finally
succeeded in so doing. The obstinate adherence to
old forms was possibly part of a nervous fear of the
unknown future. The love for existing forms of
furniture was therefore part of this apprehensive
retention of tradition. Not only was the resistance
of town fashions a strong feature, but local prejudices
prevailed against the adoption of designs belonging
to rival counties. To this day the Staffordshire
clothes-horse, carried on pulleys to the ceiling when
not in use, differs from the clothes-horse of the
cottager in the South with no such mechanical
device. In Edinburgh, in the narrow closes, there
is a kind of gallows projecting from the windows.</p>

<p>These apparently minor details which find their
embodiment in articles of everyday use, fascinate
and hold the attention of the acute collector of
cottage furniture.</p>

<p>The same local types apply to the art of the potter
and are well known to collectors. There are Sussex
"tygs" and Nottingham "bears" and Sunderland
and Newcastle jugs and mugs. Bristol had its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
characteristic earthenware, and the Lowestoft china
factory was strongly Suffolk in its homely inscriptions
with a touch of dialect.</p>

<p><b>Welsh Carving.</b>&mdash;Wales is famous for the abundance
of the oak farmhouse furniture proudly kept to this
day in families who have held the same homestead
sometimes for centuries. One of the most noticeable
features is the elaboration of the carving and its
native representation, coarsely carved, without
foreign influence, of birds and beasts and heraldic
monsters which largely figure in the decorative
panels of chests, and especially dressers. So popular
was oak that it might almost be advanced that
there never was any mahogany in Wales. But it
is indisputable that the great outburst in carved
mahogany chairbacks coincident with the advent of
Chippendale and the publication of his <i>Director</i>,
never penetrated Wales, although it led to the
foundation of a remarkable school of woodcarving
on the new lines in Ireland, known as Irish Chippendale,
a study of which can be made in Mr. Owen
Wheeler's volume on old furniture.</p>

<p>The intense love of the Welsh woodcarver for
intricacy is hardly less than that of the sturdy Swiss
craftsmen environed by mountains. Perhaps the long
winters and the solitary life influence the development
of individual character in the applied arts.
The Welsh love-spoons of wood, linked together
and exhibiting delicate pierced work and minute
carving of no mean order, are among other attractive
specimens of native art. Ironwork of fine quality
is also to be found in Wales.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
A carved oak chest of Welsh origin, dated 1636,
with Welsh inscription on lid, is illustrated (p. <a href="#Page_271">269</a>).
The table on which it stands is of a later date. The
carving in this piece is delicate and the middle panel
is typical of the representation of birds and foliage.
The Welsh cupboard on the same page typifies the
coarse woodcarving associated with Welsh farmhouse
art. In style this really belongs to a date
not later than 1650. But it is dated 1710 and bears
the initials "I.S." This is an interesting example,
showing how middle-Jacobean styles lingered in
country districts remote from outside influence until
the early eighteenth century.</p>

<p>An elm wardrobe, probably about 1670 in date,
shows another type, but still retaining the coarse
character of its carving and its well-filled panels
and uprights (illustrated p. <a href="#Page_273">273</a>).</p>

<p><b>Scottish Types.</b>&mdash;Scotland has antiquities of her own
which are closely allied to those of all the Gaelic
races. As with Welsh carved farmhouse furniture,
there is a marked leaning towards coarse style. As
a rule it is too utilitarian in appearance to display
much carving. The spinning-wheel is still found
in farmhouses, and is still used in Harris and the
outlying islands. Sometimes these old Highland
spinning-wheels come into the market with the
smooth surface worn by generations of workers, a
surface impossible to reproduce. The Scottish ironwork
is especially interesting. Perhaps the most
curious of the Scottish antiquities is the crusie. This
is undoubtedly a survival of the classic oil lamp. It
consists of a shallow trough with a spout in which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
the wick stands, the oil being contained in the trough
(see illustration, p. <a href="#Page_288">289</a>).</p>

<p><b>Lancashire Furniture.</b>&mdash;The especial characteristics
of Lancashire-made furniture are a strong leaning to
solid structure and a very noticeable reticence in
carving. Well-balanced as a rule, and possessing
good joinery, they have been favourites with collectors
of furniture designed for modern use. A
Queen Anne oak dresser illustrated (p. <a href="#Page_137">135</a>) shows
this Lancashire sturdiness at its best. This style
of large dresser with cabriole legs is associated with
Lancashire cabinet work.</p>

<p>A Lancashire dresser, the date of which is from
about 1730 to 1750, shows the oak dresser inlaid with
mahogany. The carved pediment and the carved
underwork beneath the drawers mark this as an
unusual specimen (p. <a href="#Page_273">273</a>).</p>

<p>A typical Lancashire oak settle is illustrated (p. <a href="#Page_279">279</a>),
showing the Jacobean style in the carved work and
in the arms. In date this is about 1660. It will be
noticed that the front of the seat has a row of holes,
which, prior to the upholstered cushion, a later
addition, were intended for ropes to support a
cushion, much in the same manner as the iron laths
of a modern bedstead.</p>

<p>On the same page is illustrated an oak chest of
drawers of Yorkshire origin, in date about 1770. Its
plain lines suggest the Hepplewhite types of subdued
character.</p>

<p>In regard to spindle-back chairs, Lancashire offers
distinctive varieties. Two examples are illustrated
(p. <a href="#Page_275">275</a>) as indicating this local type.</p>

<b>Three Legged Tables.</b>&mdash;Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire,
Cambridge, and Essex have produced a type of
tables termed colloquially "cricket tables," possibly
because the three legs are suggestive of three stumps.
The term is a foolish one and not very appropriate.
A very interesting flap-top table with the three flaps
to turn down, illustrated (p. <a href="#Page_275">275</a>), is a very rare Hertfordshire
example. This is small in size, having only
a diameter of two and a half feet.</p>

<p>Two other tables, one in date about 1700 and the
other, of slender form, in date about 1750, are typical
of this class of table. A very interesting table is a
specimen from the Isle of Man having three carved
legs with knee-breeches and buckle shoes.</p>

<p>Sussex is also well-known for her ironwork (see
Chapter X.).</p>

<p>Norfolk and Suffolk used to have a class of oak
furniture of quaint type, less cumbersome than the
Welsh. A type of Sheraton Windsor chair, often
inlaid with brass, used also to be found there.</p>

<p>On the whole, those localities which are removed
from important towns are the richest in cottage
furniture, for example, Wales, Devonshire, Cumberland,
Northumberland, and parts of Yorkshire. In
places, where the prosperity of the peasants is of long
standing, the cottage furniture has been maintained
whole almost until the present day.</p>

<p>Altogether the study of local types affords considerable
scope for critical study. It is essential that
such pieces should be identified and classified before
it is too late. Rapidly all cottage and farmhouse
furniture is being scattered over all parts of England.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
Collectors transfer furniture from the North to the
South, and the rural treasures of the peasant have
been brought to towns and dispersed to alien districts.
The Education Act of 1870 and the halfpenny
newspaper have brought town fashions to the door of
the cottager, and the motor has laid a heavy tribute
on rustic seclusion.</p>

MISCELLANEOUS<br />
IRONWORK, Etc.</h2>

<p class="title1">CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="medium">MISCELLANEOUS IRONWORK, ETC.</span></p>

<p class="hanging2">The rushlight-holder&mdash;The dipper&mdash;The chimney crane&mdash;The
Scottish crusie&mdash;Firedogs&mdash;The Warming-pan&mdash;Sussex
firebacks&mdash;Grandfather clocks.</p>

<p>The everyday iron utensils and implements of the
cottages were simple. It is one of the curious
features of the English peasantry that just as they
clung to their oak of generations back when mahogany
was in vogue, so they adhered tenaciously
to ironwork of almost mediæval character when
other metals were in fashionable everyday use.
Thus the cottager did not feel the oncoming desire
for the brass, or later silver and plated candlesticks,
but remained firm in his affection for the rushlight-holders
in iron, the same types which his ancestors
had used, and the firedogs and firebacks of earlier
type remained to decorate his hearth. Thus ironwork
and rarely brasswork form the sum total of
the metal portion of cottage furniture. We will
deal with these various utilitarian objects one by one.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that the country farmer
was not familiar with ready-made candles, and it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
probably no more entered his head to purchase
candles in a town than it occurred to him to do
other than bake his own bread. The cottager therefore
made his candles for himself. If he were
well-to-do and could afford to entertain his friends
in modest fashion, he would doubtless like to illuminate
his table with candles of symmetrical form.
In which case he would use a candle-mould, and
the wax bought in towns would serve for this
purpose. But he was not always so rich, and
perhaps he was happiest of all with the faintly
glimmering rush dips which his forbears used.
These afforded a rough-and-ready form of lighting.
They burned and spluttered like a torch or flickered
faintly as the tallow grew thin. Their form closely
resembled an amateur's first attempt at making a
cigarette. They were made in the following manner:
the thin wirelike rushes which grew by the water's
edge were gathered and stripped of their green
surface till only the soft white pith remained. This
served as a wick. The wax was then melted over
a fire in a trough or candle-dipper, of which an
illustration appears (p. <a href="#Page_288">289</a>).</p>

<p>Across this long receptacle the pith wicks were
laid till the wax soaked into them. They were
then taken out for the wax to cool and were dipped
once or twice afterwards in order to form their
outer coating. By such a primitive process a kind
of thin taper was formed. It was not parallel along
its sides, but bulged and narrowed throughout its
length in primitive manner.</p>

naturally not fit the socket of a candlestick, and the
only receptacle would be a scissor-like mechanism
with jaws capable of clasping it at any point.
Thus we find the rushlight-holder of common use,
as illustrated (p. <a href="#Page_288">289</a>).</p>

<p>The illustrations show two rush-holders with the
rushlights affixed in position ready for lighting,
and one showing how the jaws or forceps clip
the rushlight. In practice about an inch or an
inch and a half was above the clip and the rest
below. A rushlight some twelve to fifteen inches
long would burn half an hour, and it had to
receive constant attention, being pushed upwards
every five minutes. But it must be remembered
that the persons who used this primitive form of
light did not use it for reading nor for a long
period at a time. They usually went to bed early
after sunset.</p>

<p>In regard to rushlight-holders the earliest form
was without the accompanying candle-socket, but
when the use of tallow dip candles became prevalent,
later forms are found, as illustrated, with the
candle-socket in addition to the holder for the
rushlight.</p>

<p>The Scottish crusie is an iron trough of dimensions
like a small sauceboat, which was used for lighting
purposes, and was often suspended, as in the one
illustrated (p. <a href="#Page_288">289</a>), from a crane or hanger. This
crusie was filled with oil and the illumination given
by a floating wick, much in the same manner as
classic examples, to which the shape bears a distant
resemblance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
The firedogs were always simple, doubtless the
product of the local blacksmith. Where they had
hooks along the backs they held crossbars to
prevent the logs falling into the room. The dates
of these, as of all cottage ironwork, are almost impossible
to fix, owing to the survival of the earlier
types even so late as the middle of the nineteenth
century.</p>

<p><b>The Chimney Crane.</b>&mdash;A most important part of the
cottager's fireplace was his chimney crane. These
were of two kinds, the pot-hook and the swing-arm
variety. The pot-hook hung in the chimney from
a chain, and from its teeth was fixed a catch which
might be lowered or raised to keep the cauldron at
a level with the flames.</p>

<p>The swing-arm type is more elaborate, and was
made to fit very large fireplaces, where the fire might
not invariably be in the same spot on the hearth.
This type was used in the kitchens of the better
farmhouses. Its end was fixed to the wall of the
hearth, and the pot could be swung backwards and
forwards and sideways, besides being raised or
lowered to the fire.</p>

<p>The pot-hook is of great antiquity, and belongs
to days when man first learned to cook his food.
Frequently in this country early examples are dug
up. There are fine specimens to be seen of the
late Celtic period at the Owens College Museum,
at the Northampton Museum, at the Liverpool
Museum, at the Pitt Rivers Museum at Farnham,
at the Victoria and Albert Museum, and elsewhere.</p>

<p>"Pot-hooks and hangers" is an English phrase
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
denoting the beginning of things academic, and
the French phrase <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pendre la crémaillère</i> (literally
to hang the pot-hook) is used to-day in reference
to what we term a "house-warming" party on
settling in a new abode.</p>

<p>Another interesting cottage treasure is the cake-baker.
This was a kind of thick frying-pan having
a lid, which protected the dough from the heat when
it was held over the smouldering ashes. The tops
of these are often incised with quaint patterns, the
impress of which appears on the cake.</p>

<p>Kettle-trivets are sometimes found in cottages,
possibly relics from better houses or having belonged
to the more prosperous farmer. They are not
wholly of iron, being partly of brass. The specimen
illustrated (p. <a href="#Page_288">291</a>) is of late eighteenth-century
days.</p>

<p><b>The Warming-pan.</b>&mdash;There is an especial charm
in the old brass warming-pan of the farmhouse and
the treasured highly-polished ornament of many
a proud cottager to-day. Many modern-made
warming-pans from Holland and elsewhere have
found their way into the possession of unsuspecting
collectors. But fine old English warming-pans
are interesting, and summon up memories of careful
housewives and well-aired lavender-smelling sheets in
ancient old-world inns. On fine examples inscriptions
may be found, and the incised work of the pattern
on the brass covers is often individual in character.</p>

<p>Of the examples illustrated (p. <a href="#Page_311">307</a>) one has an
incised inscription around the edge, "The Lord only
is my portion." The other has a dotted geometrical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
pattern with a star-like design of conventional floral
incised work.</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that the diligence of the housewife
has often obliterated much of the fine work of
some of these designs. The warming-pan offers in
itself a complete field for the collector. He can
compare the work of seventeenth-century Dutch
examples, with their quaint religious inscriptions
and their finely embossed and engraved ornamentation,
with English specimens of the same date.
That the warming-pan was in use in Elizabethan
days is proved by references in Shakespeare. It
has a long history, from Sir John Falstaff, when
Bardolph was bidden to put his face between the
sheets and do the office of a warming-pan, to
Mr. Pickwick&mdash;to quote Sergeant Buzfuz, "Don't
trouble yourself about the warming-pan&mdash;the
warming-pan! Why, gentlemen, who does trouble
himself about a warming-pan?"</p>

<p><b>Sussex Firebacks.</b>&mdash;The fireback was usually part
of the cottager's belongings, though perhaps only one
would figure in his house, where possibly his only
hearth was in his living-room.</p>

<p>These were cast and forged in various parts of the
country, and large numbers appear to have been
made in Sussex, which is, or rather was, the greatest
hunting-ground for good specimens of cottagers'
ironwork. Some highly interesting specimens of
these are to be herein illustrated.</p>

<p>The records of the Sussex iron industry go back to
a very early date, and the town of Lewes, in the
thirteenth century, raised taxes by charging a toll on
<a id="Page_297"></a>
<a id="Page_298"></a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
every cartload of iron admitted. Under Edward III.
the Sussex ironworks provided three thousand horseshoes
and twenty-nine thousand nails for the English
army in its campaign in Scotland. The local
rhyme&mdash;</p>

<p>is not without reason, as in Bodiam Castle and elsewhere
are mortars of Sussex work of fifteenth-century
style. In the sixteenth century a considerable
number of firebacks was made, some with the
royal arms and with the royal cipher, "E.R.," and
bearing dates and sometimes makers' names.</p>

<p>The earliest form was stamped with the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fleur-de-lys</i>
or with portions of twisted cable to form some sort
of symmetrical design. We are enabled, by the
kindness of Mr. C. Dawson, F.S.A., of Lewes, to
reproduce some Sussex firebacks from his collection.
An example of the first half of the sixteenth century,
illustrated (p. <a href="#Page_305">301</a>), shows the rope-like border impressed
on the sand mould, and the field impressed
with repetitions of a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fleur-de-lys</i> from a single stamp.
Another interesting fireback is the "Royal Oak"
design, with the initials "C.R." This is commemorative
of the escape of Charles II. from pursuit by
Cromwell's Ironsides and his refuge in the oak-tree.
It will be observed that this specimen has a moulded
edge, which is from a single wood pattern carved
in one piece. Amidst the oak foliage will be seen
three crowns, and this exuberance of loyalty bears
a resemblance to certain chairs of the period (copied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
by the score nowadays), in which the crown finds a
place in the stretcher.</p>

<p>One fireback illustrated (p. <a href="#Page_305">303</a>) shows an ironmaster
with his hammer at his forge. The adjacent
piece has the Tudor rose surmounted by the royal
crown, and bears the date 1650, slightly earlier than
the "Royal Oak" example.</p>

<p>All the foregoing specimens are native in their
conception of design. They approximate closely to
the Jacobean carved panel with its narrow range
of subjects, and have a relationship to Stuart needlework
with its royal symbolism. Later came the
Dutch influence, most marked in its effect upon the
shape, height, and character of these firebacks. This
became especially noticeable in the eighteenth century,
and in the illustrations (p. <a href="#Page_305">303</a>) of two wooden
patterns from which the firebacks were made at
Ashburnham, Sussex, this is clearly shown. The
designs are ornate and represent either some
scriptural or mythological subject. The woodcarving
is of a style strongly under Dutch influence,
and the tall proportions suggest gravestones (indeed,
in Sussex there are headstones made of iron, with
pictures and inscriptions).</p>

<p>The mode of casting these iron firebacks in sand
and the employment of wooden patterns to form the
mould into which the molten metal was to run is
familiar to any foundry in casting iron. In regard
to the early examples with the twisted cable rim,
it is conjectured that pieces of twisted rope were
actually laid on the wet sand to produce this pattern&mdash;that
is, before the use of carved wooden patterns such
<a id="Page_301"></a>

<a id="Page_303"></a>
<a id="Page_304"></a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
as are illustrated. In regard to the bolder "cable
twist" pattern, it is believed this was produced by
impression of pieces of rope stiffened with glue, and
twisted around iron rods.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The size of the wooden pattern is slightly larger
than the resultant fireback, owing to the shrinkage
of the metal on cooling. This diminution in design
is a factor in the potter's art, when figures in some
cases lose nearly a third of their original proportions
when moulded in the clay prior to firing.</p>

<p>Firebacks have attracted a considerable amount
of interest. There are many collectors, and a great
deal of close study has been applied to the subject.
Country museums in the vicinity of the Weald of
Sussex and Kent contain many notable examples,
especially those of Lewes, Hastings, Brighton,
Rochester, Maidstone, and Guildford. In the first
mentioned there are some very rare and beautiful
examples of Sussex firebacks.</p>

<p>Especially interesting in connection with the
Sussex ironworks is the illustration (p. <a href="#Page_311">309</a>) of a clock
face made by a local maker, Beeching of Ashburnham,
in the late seventeenth century. This
brass dial of a thirty-hour clock, with single hand
and alarum, is ornamented with designs showing
various phases of the iron industry as carried on in
Sussex. There is a cannon with diminutive figures
holding the match. There are cannon-balls, and a
liliputian fireback with a crown on it. Men with
pickaxes, men felling trees, and others tending the
furnaces, symbolise the business of a foundry.</p>

<p>It was not until 1690 that the minute numerals
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
were placed outside the minute divisions in clock
faces, so that this face, having the minute numerals
absent and the minute divisions in the inner circle,
presumably belongs to the late seventeenth century.</p>

<p><b>Grandfather Clocks.</b>&mdash;A volume on cottage and
farmhouse furniture would be incomplete without
some reference to grandfather clocks. At the beginning
of the eighteenth century this type of clock
had become popular. The early brass-bracket clock
known as "Cromwellian," varying from six to ten
inches in height, had a spring. With the use of the
long pendulum and revolving drums, around which
catgut is wound to support the heavy weights, these
unprotected parts required a wooden case.</p>

<p>The "lantern" or "bird-cage" clocks (wallclocks
from which the pendulum and weights hung unprotected)
lasted till about 1680, when the first
grandfather type with wood case came into use.</p>

<p>The early examples with cases exhibiting fine
marquetry are outside the scope of the class of
furniture now under consideration. In such specimens
there is frequently a round or oval opening covered
with glass in the centre of the panel.</p>

<p>In earlier types the metal dial is square, and later
it became lunetted at top, and the wood case had a
corresponding curve. In clocks made for great
houses there were chimes, and their works were by
well-known town makers. But in cottage examples,
instead of the eight-day movement, more often than
not the clock only ran for twenty-four hours. There
is little attempt at ornament in these plain oak
varieties. The case is soundly constructed, and
<a id="Page_307"></a>
<a id="Page_308"></a>
<a id="Page_309"></a>
<a id="Page_310"></a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
sometimes, in exceptional examples, the head is surmounted
by brass ball finials, as in the finer examples.
As a rule the country cabinet-maker confined himself
to an ornamental scrolled head. In later examples
the metal dial&mdash;and these come at the beginning of
the nineteenth century&mdash;is painted with some rustic
scene with figures, and frequently there is a revolving
dial showing the days of the month.</p>

<p>The entire head covering the dial is often removable
in old clocks to which there is no hinged door, as in
later made examples.</p>

<p>These country grandfather clocks are much
treasured by their owners, and have been handed
down in families for generations. Owing to the
indefatigability of collectors and their persistent and
tempting offers, many have left their old homes.
The demand has been great, and thousands of
"grandfather" clocks have been made during the
last twenty years and sold as "antique," or old cases
with plain panels have received the unwelcome
attention of the modern restorer and have been
carved to please a popular whim for carved oak
panels.</p>

<p>In regard to dates of grandfather clocks the
records of the Clockmakers' Company give a list
of makers of the eighteenth century, enabling the
period to be fairly accurately fixed. The walnut
cases inlaid with floral marquetry, often attributed
to the period 1690-1725, that is William and Mary
and Queen Anne, frequently belong to a quarter of
a century later. The case-makers clung more closely
to old designs than did the clockmakers. Hence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
the case very often is of apparently older style
than the works, though both were made contemporaneously.
In addition to this, new clocks
were put in older cases, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versa</i>, which, like
putting new pictures in old frames, adds to the gaiety
of collecting.</p>

<p>In general the London clock-cases are only
roughly indicative, in comparison with the Company
records, of contemporary styles of furniture. In
country-made pieces the wood cases are anything
from twenty to forty years behind London fashions.
For example, the arched top occurs after 1720 in
London, and after 1735 in the provinces. In the
<i>Director</i> of Chippendale and in Sheraton's and
Hepplewhite's books of designs there are illustrations
of clock cases. The progression of styles of eighteenth-century
grandfather clock cases is from plain oak
to figured walnut, black and red lacquer, floral,
"seaweed," or mosaic marquetry, and in the latter
decades of the eighteenth century inlaid mahogany
cases, and many of these have finely veneered panels.
In many country clocks oak cases are veneered in
mahogany, but as a rule country made grandfather
cases are plain oak. The example illustrated (p. <a href="#Page_311">307</a>)
indicates the plain type of solidly made provincial
piece. The clock was made by J. Paxton at St.
Neots.</p>

<p>The mahogany-cased grandfather clock is never
found in cottages. There are no Chippendale styles
in this field for the collector to search for. The
plainness of the country style has happily in many
instances preserved them from alien hands. An
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
interesting revival, chiefly on account of expense, is
found in the Dutch clock, with china face painted
with flowers, which the cottager bought in early and
middle nineteenth-century days. This form of clock
reverted to the unprotected pendulum and weights,
and is an object-lesson in what the style of English
clock was before the use of a long wooden case.
But these Dutch clocks are interesting rather than
valuable, and have not yet claimed the attention of
collectors.</p>

<span class="medium">OLD ENGLISH CHINTZES</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">By Hugh Phillips</span></p>

<p class="hanging2">The charm of old English chintz&mdash;Huguenot cloth-printers
settle in England&mdash;Jacob Stampe at the sign
of the Calico Printer&mdash;The Queen Anne period&mdash;The
Chippendale period&mdash;The age of machinery.</p>

<p>The present chapter has been added with perhaps
some justification, since it seemed to the writer that
such a subject as old English chintzes might appropriately
take its place beside the equally homely
craft of the rural cabinet-maker.</p>

<p>For the chintz is the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tapisserie d'aubusson</i> of the
peasant&mdash;it covers his chairs and drapes his windows,
giving warmth and wealth of colour to the otherwise
barren appearance of his cottage. Further, it reflects
his simple horticultural tastes, for the brilliantly
coloured roses, pansies, and convolvuluses which
shine prominently on the glazed surface of the cloth
are those flowers which are always to be found in his
garden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
Chintz or printed cotton is the only decorative
fabric known to the village upholsterer. When
persons of wealth hung their windows with silk
brocades and covered their chairs with costly needlework
and damasks, the rural cabinet-maker was
supplying his modest <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">clientèle</i> with these homely
patterns printed upon common cloth.</p>

<p>These unassuming fabrics were as much cherished
by the cottagers as anything which they possessed.
The classical ornament of expensive silks they did
not understand, and the freely treated birds and
flowers which figured on chintz represented the
Alpha and Omega of beauty in textile design.</p>

<p>So great, indeed, is the fascination of these for the
cottagers that to-day, in districts less penetrated
by modern advance, the rural populace will not
extend their affections to the up-to-date designs of
upholsterers, but insist upon the old spot and sprig
patterns of their ancestors.</p>

<p>There is much wisdom in the conservative taste of
the peasant, for the old chintz of the eighteenth and
early nineteenth centuries was of the highest artistic
merit. In the heyday of its fame the fabric was
exceedingly fashionable amongst the richest persons,
and there are abundant records of the popularity of
old English chintzes upon the Continent. For, at
its best periods, the chintz was not a base imitation
of more expensive fabrics; it did not, for instance,
occupy the relationship of pewter to silver or
moulded composition to genuine woodcarving. On
the contrary, the designing of chintzes is an art of
distinction, governed by canons which bear little
<a id="Page_319"></a>
<a id="Page_320"></a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
relationship to other decorative textile crafts. For
where the silk-weaver is confined to solid patterns
which will appear in his transverse threads, the printer
of cloths can wander unrestrained into designs of
wonderful intricacy and beauty: every colour in
nature he can imitate, and no object is too delicate
or too rich to stamp upon his cotton. Indeed, his art
stops little short of that of the painter of pictures.</p>

</div></div>

<p>A glance at the illustrations will more closely
confirm this, for such designs could not be imitated
by any other textile process, the multitudinous
twists and curves and the delicate shades and patches
of colour being only possible to the printer.</p>

<p>Interesting as is the study of old chintzes, the
history of the art in England is even more fascinating.
From the obscurity of a small local craft it became
one of our great national industries.</p>

<p>Of its earliest history in England we know nothing,
and a search among old documents fails to reveal
any traces of chintz-printing before the Renaissance.
There are several vague references to the subject in
the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, but none
of them disclose any solid information. Thus the
question of who was the first chintz-printer remains
an unsolved riddle. It appears, however, that in the
seventeenth century there was a gradual immigration
of foreign workmen of Dutch and French nationalities
who were well versed in the art of cotton-printing&mdash;then
well established upon the Continent. These
people came over in gradually increasing numbers,
their arrival culminating in the huge influx of
foreigners about 1650 to 1700.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
The majority of them were by trade silk-weavers
and printers. Their departure was a serious blow
to France, for they transferred to England what had
been great national industries in France. Settling
in and about London, the refugees peaceably recommenced
their work, and soon the weaving of
silks in Spitalfields and the printing of chintzes in
Richmond, Bow, and Old Ford became a source of
great prosperity to this country.</p>

<p>On p. <a href="#Page_321">319</a> is an illustration of a seventeenth-century
trade card of one of the chintz-printers, or,
as they were then called, calico-printers. Here we
see in a most lucid manner the process by which
chintzes were produced in the time of James II.
The inscription runs: "Jacob Stampe living at Ye
Sighn of the Callico Printer in Hounsditch Prints all
sorts of Callicoes Lineings Silkes Stuffs, New or
Ould, at Reasonable Rates."</p>

<p>A printer is standing at a table upon which is
stretched a length of cloth, which falls in folds on
the floor. He holds in his hand a wooden block,
which he is applying at intervals to the cloth. The
other hand contains a mallet, which is about to strike
the wooden block and stamp the colour firmly into
the threads of the material. Behind him is an
apprentice boy, standing over a tub of colour, preparing
the blocks for his master to use.</p>

</div></div>

<p>By so clumsy a process very delicate work could
not be produced, and, indeed, the few examples of
this period which remain are very heavy in character.
One of these, which has been lent by Mr. J. D. Phillips,
the owner, is illustrated on p. <a href="#Page_321">319</a>. It belongs to the
<a id="Page_323"></a>
<a id="Page_324"></a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
end of the seventeenth century and corresponds to
the William and Mary period of English furniture,
being contemporary with the pieces illustrated on
pp. <a href="#Page_79">77</a>, <a href="#Page_121">117</a> in the earlier chapters. It will be seen
that this example contains two portraits in costume
of the late Stuart period, possibly intended for
portraits of William and Mary. Their portraits are
of frequent occurrence on Lambeth delft of this
period.</p>

<p>The printer has only produced the outline, the
colour being added by hand with a brush, for at
this date the printing of colour by the successive
application of blocks had not been mastered. The
black ink to-day lies thick upon the cloth, as
coarsely as though it had been dabbed on with a
stencil. The material is a rough hand-woven canvas.
Printed cloths of the period of Charles II. and
James II. and William and Mary are exceedingly
rare and seldom met with, as, owing to their
roughness, they have been destroyed by subsequent
owners. A few, however, are to be found on walnut
chairs under the coverings of later date. Often,
indeed, one meets a chair covered in Victorian
horsehair which will reveal underneath the successive
coverings of many generations of owners, including
perhaps the material in which it was first
upholstered.</p>

<p>As the seventeenth century wore on and we enter
upon the early years of the eighteenth century&mdash;the
days of Queen Anne&mdash;the chintz-printers became
more prosperous. Their work, owing to its increasing
delicacy, met with great public approval,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
and it began to supplant woven silks for the purposes
of curtains, coverings, and dresses. Thus the silk-weavers
of Spitalfields found a declining market for
their goods and soon came into friction with the
printers. Much bad feeling ensued, and eventually
their quarrels resulted in the distribution of defamatory
literature which is to-day most amusing. The
weavers circulated the curious "Spittlefields Ballad"
against "Calico Madams," or the ladies who wore
chintz dresses.</p>

<p>It is not surprising that the weavers should find it
difficult to set their productions against those of the
cloth-printers, for the chintzes of this period are
surpassingly beautiful. One of them is illustrated on
p. <a href="#Page_322">323</a>. Here the material is no longer a rough
canvas, but is now a light dress cambric, similar to
the thin smooth chintz cloth which has survived till
to-day. A delicate pattern of intertwining stems
winds upwards, the stalks having blossoms of finely
cut outline and brilliant colours. Old chintzes of
this period may be recognised by their lightness and
by the long thin designs of intermingling flowers of
Indian type. These were all more or less borrowed
from the Marsupalitan printed cloths brought over
by the India trading companies, and the flowers and
colourings of this date are nearly always very closely
copied from Eastern originals, the cornflower and carnation
being among those most frequently met with.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
The ill-feeling between the printers and weavers
was of long duration, and eventually took the form of
open riots and street demonstrations similar to those
of to-day. On one occasion, in 1719, they went from
Spitalfields to Westminster and protested against the
popularity of chintzes and suggested that their use be
forbidden. On the return journey they manifested
their feelings by tearing off the chintz gowns of
various ladies whom they met upon the route.
Evidently Parliament pandered to these labour riots,
for in 1736 printed cloths were forbidden by Act of
Parliament, but this legislation was of short duration;
the Act was soon repealed and the fascinating
material became the rage once more.</p>

<p>The next stage at which we look upon chintz-printing
is about 1760, in the middle of the period
of Chippendale furniture. This is the golden period
of its printing. Technically and artistically the
hand-printed chintz now reached its climax. Colour-work
by superimposed blocks was in full swing, and
the designer had, in the works of contemporary
artists, a wider field for the selection of subjects
suitable for his fabric. Among the many varieties
of chintzes which we find at this date the most
prominent are the Gothic and Chinese designs
to suit the current taste in furniture, and the exotic
bird patterns, which are perhaps the finest of all.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p>HAND-PRINTED CHINTZ. ABOUT 1760.</p>
<p>By R. Jones, of Old Ford, London.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The formation of the designs has changed considerably
by this time and we no longer find the
intertwining or serpentine form as in the Queen
Anne chintzes. The flowers and objects to be
printed are now massed together and represented as
<a id="Page_331"></a>
<a id="Page_332"></a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
little disjointed islands floating in mid-air. By this
distinctive feature they may easily be recognised.
One of these charming exotic bird chintzes is illustrated
on p. <a href="#Page_329">327</a>. Here a pheasant is resting under
a palm-tree upon a small island of densely packed
foliage. The whole idea of the design is taken from
the Chinese porcelain of the period. The bird, the
flowers, and every object portrayed come from the
East and are drawn in the manner constantly seen
upon the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Famille Rose</i> dishes and vases of the period.
These exotic bird patterns are not exclusively found
upon chintzes, for the collector of English porcelain
will be familiar with them in the early productions of
the Bow and Worcester factories.</p>

<p>Another feature which one notices in printed fabrics
at this date is the buff ground. The cloth is white,
and the pattern is printed upon it in this state so
that the pinks, blues, and greens of the flowers
may have every advantage of transparency. The
buff background is then printed in afterwards, leaving
a thin margin around the design. In this manner
great richness and depth is given to the colours without
undue harshness, which would be the result if
they were exhibited upon a white background. The
illustration on p. <a href="#Page_329">323</a> shows a chintz in the Chinese
manner, designed to conform with the oriental
furniture of Chippendale. Here again we see the
detached islets of vegetation, but instead of exotic
birds we have Chinese vases containing flowers,
and in the foreground a rococo shell, one of the
then little-known species from the East greatly
treasured in England. The carnations and foliage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
will be readily recognised as copies from Chinese
paintings. One might illustrate a very large number
of these Chinese chintzes, but space will only permit
one example. This particular specimen is probably
unique; it is taken from an old roll of chintz printed
about 1760 and left over after the owner had curtained
his house. The roll (about twenty yards
long) has been carefully preserved and handed down
from generation to generation, so that its original
colours and soft glaze remain intact.</p>

<p>A chintz in the Gothic manner is illustrated on
p. <a href="#Page_329">327</a>. It differs slightly from the others in that the
island formation is combined with serpentine foliage.
In the centre is a patch of ground upon which are
the ruins of a Gothic church. The artist, however,
has not forgotten to please those patrons who might
prefer the Chinese style, and therefore he has quietly
added the incongruous elements of prunus flowers in
the foreground and palm-trees in the background.
At first this quaint admixture may appear a bad art,
but it must be remembered that at this quaint period
the whole principle of decorative design was upset by
the rococo school, and quaintness and delicacy of
detail outweighed the greater considerations of line
and proportion. We find a similar treatment of
design later on in many Spode plates, especially in
blue transfer-printed subjects.</p>

</div></div>

<p>In the third quarter of the eighteenth century
we enter upon a new era in the history of chintzes.
We may appropriately call it the age of machinery,
for from this date the mechanical processes came
in whereby chintz-printing was raised from the
<a id="Page_335"></a>
<a id="Page_336"></a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
position of a comparatively small craft to that of a
huge national industry. The great manufacturing
towns in the North, such as Manchester, were
rising in importance, and Lancashire was forming
the basis of its gigantic cotton trade. Following
these trade movements, the old industry of cloth-printing
gradually left its centre in London and
was developed on a larger scale in the North of
England.</p>

<p>In spite of this great commercial spirit which
seized the printing of textiles, hand-block printing
did not pass away, for it has survived till to-day as
the best method for fine artistic work; cretonnes and
chintzes produced in this manner, even during the
nineteenth century, are always good. Mechanical
roller work, however, was responsible for a large output
of work which is little worthy of preservation, and
in the nineteenth century we find much machine-printed
chintz which, to say the least, is not reminiscent
of the fine handwork which preceded it in the
mid-eighteenth century. The earliest machine-work
was carried out by means of engraved copper plates
applied to the cloth in a printer's press. One of
these is illustrated on p. <a href="#Page_330">331</a>. It is exceedingly fine
in its details, and very few old specimens of this
pattern are in existence. In several places are
inserted the printer's name and date, "R. Jones, Old
Ford, 1761." The design is doubtless borrowed from
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Toiles de Jouy</i>, printed by a Bavarian at Jouay,
near Versailles, about this time. The drawing, however,
is finer than any specimens of his work which
have come to the author's notice. A shepherdess is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
tending to her flock amid a classical ruin while she is
listening to the music of a flute. In another portion
of the design, a cock and hen are mourning for
the loss of one of their brood which has been carried
off by an eagle. This design is worthy of interest
for its superior quality, as it must have been produced
for some very fine house. There is another
specimen printed in red in the Victoria and Albert
Museum. The one which is illustrated here was
found upon an exceedingly fine Chippendale bedstead.</p>

<p>During the Hepplewhite and Sheraton periods of
furniture the chintz ceases to have its pattern
detached and grouped. Architectural details with
figures disappear, and once more the designer returns
to flowers as his subject for illustration. The foliage,
however, now takes the form of vertical stripes, being
contained within lace-like ribands placed at even
distances. On p. <a href="#Page_334">335</a> is an illustration of a chintz
about 1790 in which these features will be noticed.</p>

<p>In the nineteenth century we find the chintz
covered with disjointed sprigs, as though the flowers
had been plucked and cast upon the cloth. Their
outline is softened by a margin of dots. An illustration
of this style is shown on p. <a href="#Page_334">335</a>.</p>

</div></div>

<p>One need not pursue the history of chintzes
further, for to do so would entail a discussion of
modern methods. Suffice it to say that in the
nineteenth century we come across the hideous black
grounds, the base imitation of woven designs, leopard
skins, and other inartistic perversions. We must
rather bid adieu to this beautiful art ere it has begun
<a id="Page_339"></a>
<a id="Page_340"></a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
to decline. It will afford the reader much pleasure
if he should form a collection of old specimens and
frame them around his walls, for then he will fully
appreciate their charm. In examining his own
collection the author has spent many a pleasant hour,
for these gaily coloured chintzes are among the most
articulate relics which have come down to us. They
breathe the spirit, the feelings, and the ideals of the
periods wherein they were made. They show lucidly
the various changes in fashion and the rise and wane
in the popularity of certain forms of decoration. So
delectable are their soft, faded colours, so fascinating
are the designs, and above all, so enchanting is the
old-world musty scent which always clings to them,
that it would be hard indeed to withhold one's
affection from them.</p>
